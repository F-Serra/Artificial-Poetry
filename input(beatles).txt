Here comes the sun, here comes the sun,
And I say it's all right
Little darling, it's been a long cold lonely winter
Little darling, it feels like years since it's been here
Here comes the sun, here comes the sun
And I say it's all right
Little darling, the smiles returning to the faces
Little darling, it seems like years since it's been here
Here comes the sun, here comes the sun
And I say it's all right
Sun, sun, sun, here it comes...
Sun, sun, sun, here it comes...
Sun, sun, sun, here it comes...
Sun, sun, sun, here it comes...
Sun, sun, sun, here it comes...
Little darling, I feel that ice is slowly melting
Little darling, it seems like years since it's been clear
Here comes the sun, here comes the sun,
And I say it's all right
It's all right

I once had a girl or should I say she once had me
She showed me her room, isn't it good Norwegian wood
She asked me to stay and she told me to sit anywhere
So I looked around and I noticed there wasn't a chair
I sat on a rug biding my time drinking her wine
We talked until two and then she said: 'It's time for bed'
She told me she worked in the morning and started to laugh
I told her I didn't and crawled off to sleep in the bath
And when I awoke I was alone, this bird had flown
So I lit a fire, isn't it good Norwegian wood

I once had a girl, or should I say, she once had me
She showed me her room, isn't it good, norwegian wood?
She asked me to stay and she told me to sit anywhere
So I looked around and I noticed there wasn't a chair
I sat on the rug, biding my time, drinking her wine
We talked until two and then she said, "It's time for bed"
She told me she worked in the morning and started to laugh
I told her I didn't and crawled off to sleep in the bath
And when I awoke I was alone, this bird had flown
So I lit a fire, isn't it good, norwegian wood?

You know you made me cry
I see no use in wondering why
I cry for you
And now you've changed your mind
I see no reason to change mine
I cry it's through, oh
You're giving me the same old line
I'm wondering why
You hurt me then
You're back again
No, no, no, not a second time
You know you made me cry
I see no use in wondering why
I cry for you, yea
And now you've changed your mind
I see no reason to change mine
I cry it's through, oh
You're giving me the same old line
I'm wondering why
You hurt me then
You're back again
No, no, no, not a second time
Not a second time
Not the second time
No, no, no, no, no
No, no no

Not guilty
For getting in your way, while you try to steal the day
Not guilty
I'm not nodding for the rest, I'm
not trying to steal you vest
I end up trying to be smart I only want what I can get
I'm really sorry for your aging head, but like you heard me said
Not guilty
Though you signing me a writ, while I'm trying to do my bit
I don't expect to take your hoard I only want what I can get
I'm really sorry that you're underfed, but like you heard me said
Not guilty
Not guilty
For looking like a freak, making friends with every Sikh
Not guilty
For leading you astray, on the road to Masalay
I won't upset the apple cart I only want what I can get
I'm really sorry that you've been mislead, but like you heard me said
Not guilty

If you're listening to this song
You may think the chords are going wrong
But they're not;
He just wrote it like that.
It doesn't really matter what chords I play
What words I say or time of day it is
As it's only a Northern song
It doesn't really matter what clothes I wear
Or how I fare or if my hair is brown
When it's only a Northern song.
When you're listening late at night
You may think the band are not quite right
But they are, they just play it like that
It doesn't really matter what chords I play
What words I say or time of day it is
As it's only a Northern song.
It doesn't really matter what clothes I wear
Or how I fare or if my hair is brown
When it's only a Northern song.
If you think the harmony
Is a little dark and out of key
You're correct, there's nobody there.
It doesn't really matter what chords I play
What words I say or time of day it is
And I told you there's no one there.

I found it out
What love is all about
And every day
It sure lets out
I see my baby
I get weak in my knees
There's nothing shaking
But the leaves on the trees
My pappie told me
There'd be times like these
There's nothing shaking
But the leaves on the trees
We meet the gang
And go to rocking Joes
The cats are something
On the heels and toes
I grab my baby
Tried to give her a squeeze
There's nothing shaking
But the leaves on the trees
Well why must she be
Such a doggone tease?
There's nothing shaking
But the leaves on the trees
She's got a way
That makes me act like a fool
Spent my money
Then she plays me cool
I begged her for kisses
On my bended knees
Oh won't you give me
Some loving, baby
Please please please
Though I keep trying hard
To make her mine
One day the wind will blow
And the sun will shine
Till that time
She puts my heart at ease
There's nothing shaking
But the leaves on the trees
She locked my heart
And threw away the keys
There's nothing shaking
But the leaves on the trees, yeah
She's got a way
That makes me act like a fool
Spent my money
Then she plays me cool
I'm begging for her kisses
On my bended knees
Oh won't you give me
Some of your loving, baby
Please please please
Though I keep trying hard
To make her mine
One day the wind will blow
And the sun will shine
Till that time
She puts my heart at ease
There's nothing shaking
But the leaves on the trees
She locked my heart
And threw away the keys
There's nothing shaking
But the leaves on the trees
There's nothing shaking
But the leaves on the trees
There's nothing shaking
But the leaves on the trees
There's nothing shaking
But the leaves on the trees

He's a real nowhere Man,
Sitting in his Nowhere Land,
Making all his nowhere plans
for nobody.
Doesn't kave a point of view,
Knows not where he's going to,
Isn't he a bit like you and me
Nowhere Man, please listen,
You don't know what you're missing,
Nowhere Man, the world is at your command.
He's as blind as he can be,
Just sees what he wants to see,
Nowhere Man can you see me at all
Doesn't kave a point of view,
Knows not where he's going to,
Isn't he a bit like you and me
Nowhere Man, don't worry,
Take your time, don't hurry,
Leave it all till somebody else
lend you a hand.
He's a real Nowhere Man,
Sitting in his Nowhere Land,
Making all his nowhere plans
For nobody.

I'd like to be under the sea
In an octopus's garden in the shade
He'd let us in, knows where we've been
In his octopus's garden in the shade
I'd ask my friends to come and see
An octopus's garden with me
I'd like to be under the sea
In an octopus's garden in the shade
We would be warm below the storm
In our little hideaway beneath the waves
Resting our head on the sea bed
In an octopus's garden near a cave
We would sing and dance around
Because we know we can't be found
I'd like to be under the sea
In an octopus's garden in the shade
We would shout and swim about
The coral that lies beneath the waves
(Lies beneath the ocean waves)
Oh what joy for every girl and boy
Knowing they're happy and they're safe
(Happy and they're safe)
We would be so happy you and me
No one there to tell us what to do
I'd like to be under the sea
In an octopus's garden with you
In an octopus's garden with you
In an octopus's garden with you

Oh! Darling, please believe me

Believe me when I tell you

Oh! Darling, if you leave me
I'll never make it alone
Believe me when I thank you, ooo
Don't ever leave me alone
When you told me

When you told me
You didn't need me anymore

I call your name but you're not there
Was I to blame for being unfair
Oh I can't sleep at night
Since you've been gone
I never weep at night
I can't go on
Don't you know I can't take it
I don't know who can
I'm not goin' to mayayake it
I'm not that kind of man
Oh I can't sleep at night
But just the same
I never weep at night
I call your name

I want a love that's right but right is only half of what's wrong
I want a short haired girl who sometimes wears it twice as long
Now I'm stepping out this old brown shoe, baby, I'm in love with you
I'm so glad you came here, it won't be the same now, I'm telling you
You know you pick me up from where some try to drag me down
And when I see your smile replace every thoughtless frown
Got me escaping from this zoo, baby, I'm in love with you
I'm so glad you came here, it won't be the same now when I'm with you
If I grow up I'll be a singer wearing rings on every finger
Not worrying what they or you say I'll live and love and maybe someday
Who knows, baby, you may comfort me
I may appear to be imperfect, my love is something you can't reject
I'm changing faster than the weather if you and me should get together
Who knows, baby, you may comfort me
I want that love of yours, to miss that love is something I'd hate
I'll make an early start, I'm making sure that I'm not late
For you sweet top lip I'm in the queue, baby, I'm in love with you
I'm so glad you came here, it won't be the same now when I'm with you
I'm so glad you came here, it won't be the same now when I'm with you

My baby says she's trav'ling on the one after 909
I said move over honey I'm travelling on that line
I said move over once, move over twice
Come on baby don't be cold as ice
I said I'm trav'ling on the one after 909
I begged her not to go and I begged her on my bended knees
You're only fooling around, you're fooling around with me
I said move over once, move over twice
Come on baby don't be cold as ice
I said I'm trav'ling on the one after 909
I got my bag, run to the station
Railman says you've got the the wrong location
I got my bag, run right home
Then I find I've got the number wrong
Well I said I'm trav'ling on the one after 909
I said move over honey I'm travelling on that line
I said move over once, move over twice
Come on baby don't be cold as ice
I said I'm trav'ling on the one after 909
I got my bag, run to the station
railman says you've got the the wrong location
I got my bag, run right home

I said we're trav'ling on the one after 90
I said we're trav'ling on the one after 90
I said we're trav'ling on the one after 909

In Penny Lane there is a barber showing photographs
Of every head he's had the pleasure to have know.
And all the people that come and go
Stop and say hello.
On the corner is a banker with a motorcar,
The little children laugh at him behind his back.
And the banker never wears a mack
In the pouring rain, very strange.
Penny Lane is in my ears and in my eyes.
There beneath the blue suburban skies
I sit, and meanwhile back
In Penny Lane there is a fireman with an hourglass
And in his pocket is a portrait of the Queen.
He likes to keep his fire engine clean,
It's a clean machine.
Penny Lane is in my ears and in my eyes.
A four of fish and finger pies
In summer, meanwhile back
Behind the shelter in the middle of a roundabout
The pretty nurse is selling poppies from a tray
And tho' she feels as if she's in a play
She is anyway.
In Penny Lane the barber shaves another customer,
We see the banker sitting waiting for a trim.
And then the fireman rushes in
From the pouring rain, very strange.
Penny lane is in my ears and in my eyes.
There beneath the blue suburban skies
I sit, and meanwhile back.
Penny lane is in my ears and in my eyes.
There beneath the blue suburban skies,
Penny Lane.

Have you seen the little piggies
Crawling in the dirt?
And for all the little piggies
Life is getting worse
Always having dirt to play around in
Have you seen the bigger piggies
In their starched white shirts?
You will find the bigger piggies
Stirring up the dirt
Always have clean shirts to play around in
In their styes with all their backing
They don't care what goes on around
In their eyes there's something lacking
What they need's a damn good whacking
Everywhere there's lots of piggies
Living piggy lives
You can see them out for dinner
With their piggy wives
Clutching forks and knives to eat their bacon
[One more time...]

All my little plans and schemes
Lost like some forgotten dream
Seems like all I really was doing
Was waiting for you
Just like little girls and boys
Playing with their little toys

No need to be alone

It's real, yes it's real love
It's real
From this moment on I know
Exactly where my life will go
Seems that all I really was doing
Was waiting for love
Don't need to be afraid
No need to be afraid
It's real love

Just let me hear some of that rock and roll music
Any old way you choose it
It's got a back beat, you can't lose it
Any old time you use it
It's gotta be rock and roll music
If you wanna dance with me
If you wanna dance with me
I've got no kick against modern jazz
Unless they try to play it too darn fast
And lose the beauty of the melody
Until they sound just like a symphony
That's why I go for that that rock and roll music
Any old way you choose it
It's got a back beat, you can't lose it
Any old time you use it
It's gotta be rock and roll music
If you wanna dance with me
If you wanna dance with me
I took my loved one over across the tracks
So she can hear my man awail a sax
I must admit they have a rocking band
Man, they were blowing like a hurricane
That's why I go for that that rock and roll music
Any old way you choose it
It's got a back beat, you can't lose it
Any old time you use it
It's gotta be rock and roll music
If you wanna dance with me
If you wanna dance with me
Way down South they had a jubilee
The jokey folks they had a jamboree
They're drinking home brew from a water cup
The folks dancing there are all shook up
And started playing that that rock and roll music
Any old time you use it
It's got a back beat, you can't lose it
Any old time you use it
It's gotta be rock and roll music
If you wanna dance with me
If you wanna dance with me
Don't care to hear them play a tango
And In The Mood they take a mambo
It's way to early for a congo
So keep a rocking that piano
That's why I go for that that rock and roll music
Any old time you use it
It's got a back beat, you can't lose it
Any old time you use it
Gotta be rock and roll music
If you wanna dance with me
If you wanna dance with me

Well gonna write a little letter
Gonna mail it to my local D.J.
It's a rocking little record
I want my jockey to play
Roll over Beethoven
I gotta hear it again today
You know my temperature's rising
And the jukebox's blows a fuse
My hearts beating rhythm
And my soul keeps singing the blues
Roll over Beethoven
And tell Tchaikovsky the news
I got a rocking pneumonia
I need a shot of rhythm and blues
I think I got it off the writer
Sittin' down by the rhythm review
Roll over Beethoven
We're rockin' in two by two
Well if you fell you like it
Well get your lover and reel and rock it
Roll it over and move on up
Just jump around and reel and rock it
Roll it over
Roll over Beethoven
A rocking in two by two, oh
Well early in the morning
I'm a giving you the warning
Don't you step on my blue suede showes
Hey little little
Gonna play my fiddle
Ain't got nothing to lose
Roll over Beethoven
And tell Tchaikovsky the news
You know she winks like a glow worm
Dance like a spinning top
She got a crazy partner
Oughta see them reel an rock
Long as she's got a dime
The music will never stop
Roll over Beethoven
Roll over Beethoven
Roll over Beethoven
Roll over Beethoven
Roll over Beethoven
And dig these rhythm and blues

They're gonna put me in the movies
They're gonna make a big star out of me
We'll make a film about a man that's sad and lonely
And all I gotta so is act naturally
Well, I'll bet you I'm gonna be a big star
Might win an Oscar you can never tell
The movies gonna make me a big star
'Cause I can play the part so well
Well I hope you come and see me in the movies
Then I know that you will plainly see
The biggest fool that ever hit the big time
And all I gotta do is act naturally
We'll make the scene about a man that's sad and lonely
And beggin down upon his bended knee
I'll play the part but I won't need rehearsal
All I gotta do is act naturally
Well, I'll bet you I'm gonna be a big star
Might win an Oscar you can never tell
The movies gonna make me a big star
'Cause I can play the part so well
Well I hope you come and see me in the movies
Then I know that you will plainly see
The biggest fool that ever hit the big time
And all I gotta do is act naturally

Creme tangerine and montelimat
A ginger sling with a pineapple heart
A coffee dessert, yes, you know it's good news
But you'll have to have them all pulled out
After the Savoy truffle
Cool cherry cream and a nice apple tart
I feel your taste all the time we're apart
Coconut fudge really blows down those blues
But you'll have to have them all pulled out
After the Savoy truffle
You might not feel it now
But when the pain cuts through
You're going to know and how
The sweat is going to fill your head
When it becomes too much
You're going to shout aloud
But you'll have to have them all pulled out
After the Savoy truffle.
You know that what you eat you are
But what is sweet now, turns so sour
We all know Ob-La-Di-Bla-Da
But can you show me, where you are?
Creme tangerine and montelimat
A ginger sling with a pineapple heart
A coffee dessert--yes you know its good news
But you'll have to have them all pulled out
After the Savoy truffle
Yes you'll have to have them all pulled out
After the Savoy truffle

The leaves of brown
came tumbling down,
remember in september in the rain.
The sun went out
just like a light,
remember in september in the rain.
To every word
of love I heard you whisper
the raindrops seems
to play a sweet refrain.
Thought it's spring,
to me it's still september,
oh that september in the rain.
To every word
of love I heard you whisper
the raindrops seems
to play a sweet refrain.
Thought it's spring,
to me it's still september,
oh that september in the rain.
I said I said it's september in the rain.
Ah september in the rain.

Sgt. Pepper's lonely, Sgt. Pepper's lonely
Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band

It was twenty years ago today,
Sgt. Pepper taught the band to play
They've been going in and out of style
But they're guaranteed to raise a smile.
So may I introduce to you
The act you've known for all these years,
Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band.
We're Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band,
We hope you will enjoy the show,

It's certainly a thrill.
You're such a lovely audience,
We'd like to take you home with us,
We'd love to take you home.
I don't really want to stop the show,
But I thought that you might like to know,
That the singer's going to sing a song,
And he wants you all to sing along.
So let me introduce to you
The one and only Billy Shears
And Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band.

Rattle and roll,
I said shake, rattle, and roll
Well you never do nothing
To save your doggone soul
Well get out of that kitchen
And shake those pots and pans
I said get out of that kitchen
And shake those pots and pans
I said to my soul:
You're the devil in the frying pan
Well I said shake, rattle, and roll
I said shake, rattle, and roll
I said shake, rattle, and roll
I said shake, rattle, and roll
Well you never do nothing

She loves you, yeah, yeah, yeah
She loves you, yeah, yeah, yeah
She loves you, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
You think you lost your love,
When I saw her yesterday.
It's you she's thinking of
And she told me what to say.
She says she loves you
And you know that can't be bad.
Yes, she loves you
And you know you should be glad. Ooh!
She said you hurt her so
That she almost lost her mind.
And she said to let you know
You're not the hurting kind.
She says she loves you
And you know that can't be bad.
Yes, she loves you
And you know you should be glad. Ooh!
She loves you, yeah, yeah, yeah
She loves you, yeah, yeah, yeah
And with a love like that
You know you should be glad.
And now it's up to you,
I think it's only fair,
Pride can hurt you too
Apologize to her
Because she loves you
And you know that can't be bad.
Yes, she loves you
And you know you should be glad. Ooh!
She loves you, yeah, yeah, yeah
She loves you, yeah, yeah, yeah
And with a love like that
You know you should be glad.
With a love like that
You know you should be glad.
With a love like that,
You know you sho-o-ould
Be Glad!
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Yeah, yeah, yeah Ye-ah.

My love don't give me presents
I know that she's no peasant
Only ever has to give me
Love forever and forever
My love don't give me presents
Turn me on when I get lonely
People tell me that she's only
Fooling, I know she isn't
She don't give the boys the eye
She hates to see me cry
She is happy just to hear me say
That I will never leave her
She don't give the boys the eye
She will never make me jealous
Gives me all her time as well as
Loving, don't ask me why
She's a woman who understands
She's a woman who loves her man
My love don't give me presents
I know that she's no peasant
Only ever has to give me love
Forever and forever
My love don't give me presents
Turn me on when I get lonely
People tell me that she's only
Fooling, I know she isn't
She's a woman who understands
She's a woman who loves her man
My love don't give me presents
I know that she's no peasant
Only ever has to give me
Love forever and forever
My love don't give me presents
Turn me on when I get lonely
People tell me that she's only
Fooling, I know she isn't
She's a woman, she's a woman
She's a woman, she's a woman

I forgot to remember to forget her
I can't seem to get her off my mind
I thought I'd never miss her
But I've found out somehow
I think about her almost all the time
Well the day she went away
I made myself a promise
That I'd soon forget we'd ever met
But something sure is wrong
Cos I'm so blue and lonely
I forgot to remember to forget
Well the day she went away
I made myself a promise
That I'd soon forget we'd ever met
But something sure is wrong
Cos I'm so blue and lonely
I forgot to remember to forget

Wednesday morning at five o'clock as the day begins
Silently closing her bedroom door
Leaving the note that she hoped would say more
She goes downstairs to the kitchen clutching her hankerchief
Quietly turning the backdoor key
Stepping outside she is free
She (We gave her most of our lives)
Is leaving (Sacraficed most of our lives)
Home (We gave her everything money could buy)
She's leaving home after living alone
For so many years (Bye bye)
Father snores as his wife gets into her dressing gown
Picks up the letter that's lying there
Standing alone at the top of the stairs
She breaks down and cries to her husband "Daddy our baby's gone
Why would she treat us so thoughtlessly?
How could she do this to me?"
She (We never thought of ourselves)
Is leaving (Never a thought for ourselves)
Home (We struggled hard all our lives to get by)
She's leaving home after living alone
For so many years (Bye bye)
Friday morning at nine o'clock she is far away
Waiting to keep the appointment she made
Meeting a man from the motor trade
She (What did we do that was wrong)
Is having (We didn't know it was wrong)
Fun (Fun is the one thing that money can't buy)
Something inside that was always denied
For so many years (Bye bye)
She's leaving home
Bye bye

They say that everyone

So how come no one
wants me.
Then they say that everyone
needs someone.
So how come no one

It's the ugly duck,

Something in the way she moves
Attracts me like no other lover
Something in the way she woos me
I don't want to leave her now
You know I believe her now
Somewhere in her smile she knows
That I don't need no other lover
Something in her style that shows me
Don't want to leave her now
You know I believe her now
You're asking me will my love grow
I don't know, I don't know
You stick around now it may show
I don't know, I don't know
Something in the way she knows
And all I have to do is think of her
Something in the things she shows me
Don't want to leave her now
You know I believe her now

Wise: Boys! And what I was thinking was, er ... would you like to do a number with us, you know, we'd like to do a number together
Beatles: Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Wise: You fancy that? Great!
Morecambe: Yeah-eh! It's the Kay sisters, they've come! Great! Fabulous!
Wise: The Kay sisters?! This is...
Morecambe: Look, they've dyed their hair!
Wise: ...this is the Beatles!
Morecambe: Hello, Beatle! Where is he?
Wise: Where is he?
Morecambe: There he is! Hello, Bongo! Hey.
Wise: That's Ringo!
Morecambe: Oh, is he there as well? ... oh dear
Wise : Boys!
Morecambe: By golly!
Wise: As you can gather this is Eric. Say hello to Eric.
Morecambe: Yes.
Paul: Hello, Eric!
Morecambe: Hello, mate!
Paul: I remember you, you're the one with the short fat hairy legs!
Morecambe: No, no, no. It's... no, he's the one with the short fat hairy legs. No, him.
Wise: Yeah.
George: We're the ones with the big fat hairy heads. Get out of that!
[George puts his hand (opened flat, palm down, under Eric M's chin when saying "Get out of that".) That was Eric's trick on Ernie (a running gag). "Get out of that, eh? You can't can you!!". If that's not funny to you, you had to be there!]
Morecambe: Hey! Hey-hey! What's it like being famous?
John: Well, it's not like in your day, you know.
[John, insulting them, by saying they are oldies with this remark! Makes a gesture of "very far away" with his hands]
Morecambe: Ha! That was an insult, that is!
Morecambe: You didn't expect that, did you?
Wise: No!
Morecambe: What do you mean "not like in my day"?
John: Well, me dad used to tell me about you, you know.
[John indicated with his hand how tall he was, when his Dad told him ... just a little kid. Eric misunderstands (deliberately) ...
Paul: ... In the old days.
Morecambe: You've only got a little dad have you?
Morecambe: [mocking] Yer dad used to tell yer, that's a bit strong, innit? Alright, Bonzo!
Wise: That's Ringo!
Morecambe: Yeah, him as well!
Morecambe: Get 'em off, you've done enough.
[Pretending their "time slot" is up, get them off the stage, or done enough damage with their behaviour :) ]
Wise: What do you mean "done enough"?
Morecambe: No, well I'm getting insulted now ...
Wise: No. Look, what I was going to suggest was let's do a number with the boys!
Morecambe: Oh yes! One that the dad will remember. That I used to do, with your dad.
Wise: You go and get changed.
Morecambe: Yes, I will, right.
Wise: What do you think we should do, boys? What about something that's more suitable for Eric's age?
John: "Moonlight Bay".
Wise: "Moonlight Bay".
John: Yeah.
Wise: So ladies and gentlemen, we're gonna make history on television. For the first time we have Morecambe and Wise and the Beatles presenting to you that wonderful old fashioned number "Moonlight Bay". You all remember the number. Okay, fellows, that's great, you look marvellous! You ready?
John/Paul: Aye
Paul: Alright, ready.
Wise: Alright, we'll take it from the top.
Wise: Okay, Kenny, thank you

Steek 'm op, steek 'm in je mond en begin
te roken, smoken en haal 'm in je longen
en als je net bent begonnen
dan voel je dat de stress wel wordt verdrongen.
Door die blunt straight to the point,
een splunt, een stikkie of liever een joint.
Van harddrugs heb ik geen hoge dunk ik rook alleen skunk,
dus noem me geen junk punt
Pak het op, rol het op, steek'm op en rook 'm op
je passed 'm door en tikt erop en opeens dan is ie op.
Hasj & Weed wiede wiede wiet,
je ruikt hem wel je rookt hm niet.
Ben je stoned en word je dronken
je hart gaan bonken, nu ben je stronken.
Je taaie kwaaie moet zich ontlaaien,
dus het wordt weer tijd om een joint te draaien.
Steek 'm op ja!
Steek 'm op ja!
Steek 'm op ja!
Steek 'm op ja!
Steek 'm op ja!
Steek 'm op ja!
Rol 'm op en steek m op en rook 'm op ja!
Waar King woont wordt wied gekloond,
dus nu wordt hij stoned, beloond en bekroond.
Een puur natuur kuur van een uur, van King Arthur is niet zo duur.
Eigen teeltje, want dat scheelt je toch een geeltje
of een meier, we worden higher, het maakt ons blijer,
en als ik ga vrijen dan blijf ik glijen.
King's plantage wordt een ravage,
als we hem oogsten worden we het hoogste.
M'n plantjes worden dope, m'n plantjes worden doper,
je kan wel naar de coffeeshop maar dit is goedkoper.
Deze week is spacecake week, door King gekweekt dus Def bezweek.
Bij elk trekkie denkt ie aan een plekkie voor een stekkie
ik rol hem in een shaggie en dan voel ik me te gekkie!
Steek 'm op ja!
Steek 'm op ja!
Steek 'm op ja!
Steek 'm op ja!
Steek 'm op ja!
Steek 'm op ja!
Rol 'm op en steek m op en rook 'm op ja!
Ben je blowrijp, pak de blowpijp,
en zuig er aan zoals je hoofd-pijpt.
Kom is hier griet, en proef m'n wiet,
jij zuigt me joint en ik zuig je tiet.
Geen slet in m'n bek met een sigaret
want ik rook alleen met vol pret
ik geniet ervan zoveel ik kan,
want bemoeierige bitchen houden we niet van.
Zotte teksten, ik zal er in flexen
om daarna met de posse te relaxen.
Rook je een joint dan voel je je space,
maar met de pijp krijg je echt hoogtevrees.
Kom maar gauw, het huis staat blauw,
genoeg THC voor mij en jou.
Dus wordt het saai, draai dan wat Tai,
en dan worden we zo high als een Vlaamse Papegaai.
Steek 'm op ja!
Steek 'm op ja!
Steek 'm op ja!
Steek 'm op ja!
Steek 'm op ja!
Steek 'm op ja!
Rol 'm op en steek m op en rook 'm op ja!
Steek 'm op ja!
Steek 'm op ja!
Steek 'm op ja!
Steek 'm op ja!
Steek 'm op ja!
Steek 'm op ja!
Rol 'm op en steek m op en rook 'm op ja!
All day all night in da party

She's knows a woman's place
right back there hanging by the home.

Well let me tell you well no chick made
could be the same
as Sweet Georgia Brown.
Crazy feet that dance so neat
has sweet Georgia Brown.
Fella's sigh, and even cry
for sweet Georgia Brown.
I tell you just why
you know I don't lie.
It's been said
she knocks them dead
in any old town.
Since she came right
it's a shame
how she brings them down.
In Liverpool she even dare
to critize the Beatles' hair.
With their whole fanclub
standing there
I mean sweet Georgia Brown.
I say this group is absolutely marvellous with the piano, don't you
think so. Not too commercial, boys, not too commercial!
When it comes to music
Sweet Georgia is known to mind,
Don't buy clothes at fashion shows
but she still looks fine
Snap chicks cry,
they want to die
when Georgie does the twist
I never would try
to tell you just why.

My tears are falling
'cos you've taken her away.
And though it really hurts me so,
there something that I got to say:
Take good care of my baby,
please don't ever make her blue.
Just tell her that you love her
make sure you're thinking of her
in everything you say and do.
Take good care of my baby,
now don't you ever make her cry.
Just let your love surround her,
paint rainbows all around her,
don't let her see the cloudy sky.
Once upon a time
that little girl was mine.
If I had been true
I know she'd never been with you.
So take good care of my baby,
be just as kind as you can be.
And if you should discover
that you don't really love her
just send my baby back home to me.
Take good care of my baby,
be just as kind as you can be.
And if you should discover
that you don't really love her
just send my baby back home to me.
Take good care of my baby,
take good care of my baby,
take good care of my baby.

If you leave me baby,
I don't know what I'll do.
I guess I would die, sweetheart
if I don't get a kiss from you.
Take out some insurance on me baby,
take out some insurance on me baby.
Well if you ever ever say goodbye,
I'm gonna walk right back and die.
Oh if you want me baby,
you got to come to me.
I'm just like a string feeling,
You just can't lose me.
Take out some insurance on me baby,
ooo some insurance on me baby.
Well if you ever ever say goodbye,
I'm gonna walk right over and die.
Well if you want me baby,
mm you got to come to me.
I'm just like a strong feeling,
You just can't lose me.
Take out some insurance on me baby,
mm some insurance on me baby.
Well if you ever ever say goodbye,
I'm gonna walk right over and die.
Well if you leave me baby,
I don't know what I'll do.
I guess I would die, sweetheart,
if I don't get a kiss from you.
Take out some insurance on me baby,
ooo some goddamn insurance on me baby.
If you ever ever say goodbye,
I'm gonna walk right over and die.

Tell me why you cried, and why you lied to me
Tell me why you cried, and why you lied to me
Well I gave you everything I had
But you left me sitting on my own
Did you have to treat me oh so bad
All I do is hang my head and moan
Tell me why you cried, and why you lied to me
Tell me why you cried, and why you lied to me
If there's something I have said or done

Tell me why you cried, and why you lied to me
Tell me why you cried, and why you lied to me

I'm gonna search this town
From door to door
The love I crave
I can't find no more
I got to find my baby
I declare there ain't no lie
I ain't had no real good loving
Since that woman said goodbye
You know I hate to see the sun
Sinking to the west
Cos I know my whole life's
Gonna be one solid mess
I got to find my baby
I declare there ain't no lie
I ain't had no real good loving
Since that woman said goodbye
Well ever since the day
That she said we were through
I've been nervous
And shook up too
I got to find my baby
I declare there ain't no lie
I ain't had no real good loving
Since that woman said goodbye
Well I don't care if the last thing
I ever done in my life
Is to find that little woman
Make her my wife
I got to find my baby
I declare there ain't no lie
I ain't had no real good loving
Since that woman said goodbye

Oh, oh, you've been good to me.
You made me glad when I was blue
And eternally,
I'll always be in love with you
And all I wanna do
Is thank you, girl.
Thank you, girl.
I could tell the world
A thing or two about our love.
I know, little girl,
Only a fool would doubt our love
And all I've gotta do
Is thank you, girl.
Thank you, girl.
Thank you, girl, for lovin' me
The way that you do.
Way that you do.
That's the kind of love that seems
To good to be true
And all I've gotta do
Is thank you, girl.
Thank you, girl.
Oh, oh, mmm, you've been good to me.
You made me glad when I was blue
And eternally,
I'll always be in love with you
And all I wanna do
Is thank you, girl.
Thank you, girl.
Oh, oh, mmm.
Oh, oh, mmm.

A friend says that your love
Won't mean a lot
And you know that your love
Is all you've got
At times things are so fine
And at times they're not
But when she says she loves you
That means a lot
A friend says that a love
Is never true
And you know that this
Don't apply on you
A touch can mean so much
When it's all you've got
When she says she loves you
That means a lot
Love can be deep inside
Love can be suicide
Can't you see you can't hide
What you feel when it's real
A friend says that your love
Won't mean a lot
And you know that your love
Is all you've got
A touch can mean so much
When it's all you've got
But when she says she loves you
That means a lot
Can't you see, yeah
Can't you see, yeah
Can't you see, yeah
Can't you see, yeah
Can't you see, yeah
Can't you see, yeah
Can't you see, yeah

Without going out of my door
I can know all things on Earth
Without looking out of my window
I could know the ways of Heaven
The farther one travels
The less one knows
The less one really knows
Without going out of your door
You can know all things on Earth
Without looking out of your window
You could know the ways of Heaven
The farther one travels
The less one knows
The less one really knows
Arrive without travelling
See all without looking
Do all without doing

The long and winding road that leads to your door
Will never disappear
I've seen that road before it always leads me here
Leads me to your door
The wild and windy night that the rain washed away
Has left a pool of tears crying for the day
Why leave me standing here, let me know the way
Many times I've been alone and many times I've cried
Anyway you'll never know the many ways I've tried
And still they lead me back to the long and winding road
You left me standing here a long, long time ago
Don't leave me waiting here, lead me to you door
But still they lead me back to the long and winding road
You left me standing here a long, long time ago
Don't keep me waiting here (Don't keep me wait), lead me to you door
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

Well you call me your baby
When you hold in my hand
But the way that you hurt me
I just don't understand
Well you say that you need me
Like an ocean needs sand
But the way you deceive me
I just don't understand
Well you know that I love you
More than anyone can
But a one-sided love
I just don't understand
Well you know that I love you
More than anyone can
But a one-sided love
I just don't understand
Well you call me your baby
When you hold in my hand
Oh how you can hurt me
I just don't understand

We said our goodbyes, ah, the night before
Love was in your eyes, ah, the night before
Now today I find you have changed your mind
Treat me like you did the night before
Were you telling lies, ah, the night before?
Was I so unwise, ah, the night before?
When I held you near you were so sincere
Treat me like you did the night before
Last night is a night I will remember you by
When I think of things we did it makes me wanna cry
We said our goodbye, ah, the night before
Love was in your eyes, ah, the night before
Now today I find you have changed your mind
Treat me like you did the night before
Yes
When I held you near you were so sincere
Treat me like you did the night before
Last night is a night I will remember you by
When I think of things we did it makes me wanna cry
Were you telling lies, ah, the night before?
Was I so unwise, ah, the night before?

Day after day alone on a hill
the man with the foolish grin is keeping perfectly still
But nobody wants to know him,
they can see that he`s just a fool
and he never gives an answer
but the fool on the hill sees the sun going downand the eyes in his head see the world spinning `round.
Well on the way, head in a cloud
the man of the thousand voices talking perfectly loud,
but nobody ever hears him, or the sound he appears to make
and he never seems to notice.
But the fool on the hill sees the sun going downand the eyes in his head see the world spinning `round.
And nobody seems to like him,
they can tell what he wants to do
and he never shows his feelings
But the fool on the hill sees the sun going downand the eyes in his head see the world spinning `round.
He never listens to them
he knows that they`re the fool
they don`t like him.
The fool on the hill sees the sun going downand the eyes in his head see the world spinning `round.
(Original track released 1967)

There are places I remember
All my life though some have changed
Some forever, not for better
Some have gone and some remain
All these places have their moments
With lovers and friends I still can recall
Some are dead and some are living
In my life I've loved them all
But of all these friends and lovers
There is no one compares with you
And these memories lose their meaning
When I think of love as something new
Though I know I'll never lose affection
For people and things that went before
I know I'll often stop and think about them
In my life I love you more
Though I remember I'll never lose affection
For people and things that went before
I know I'll often stop and think about them
In my life I'll love you more
In my life I'll love you more

There is a place
Where I can go
When I feel low
When I feel blue
And it's my mind
And there's no time when I'm alone
I think of you
And things you do
Go 'round my head
The things you said
Like "I love only you"
In my mind there's no sorrow
Don't you know that it's so
There'll be no sad tomorrow
Don't you know that it's so
There is a place
Where I can go
When I feel low
When I feel blue
And it's my mind
And there's no time when I'm alone
There's a place...

I've got a word or two
To say about the things that you do
You're telling all those lies
About the good things that we can have
If we close our eyes
Do what you want to do
And go where you're going to
Think for yourself
Cos I won't be there with you
I left you far behind
The ruins of the life that you have in mind
And though you still can't see
I know your mind's made up
You're gonna cause more misery
Do what you want to do
And go where you're going to
Think for yourself
Cos I won't be there with you
Although your mind's opaque
Try thinking more if just for your own sake
The future still looks good
And you've got time to rectify
All the things that you should
Do what you want to do
And go where you're going to
Think for yourself
Cos I won't be there with you
Do what you want to do
And go where you're going to
Think for yourself
Cos I won't be there with you
Think for yourself
Cos I won't be there with you

All through the day, I me mine
I me mine, I me mine
All through the night, I me mine

Now they're frightened of leaving it
Everyone's weaving it
Coming on strong all the time
All through the day I me mine

Even those tears, I me mine

No-one's frightened of playing it
Everyone's saying it
Flowing more freely than wine
All through the day I me mine
I-I-me-me mine, I-I-me-me mine
I-I-me-me mine, I-I-me-me mine
All I can hear, I me mine
I me mine, I me mine
Even those tears, I me mine
I me mine, I me mine
No-one's frightened of playing it
Everyone's saying it
Flowing more freely than wine
All through your life I me mine

There were bells on a hill
But I never heard them ringing
No, I never heard them at all
Till there was you
There were birds in the sky
But I never saw them winging
No, I never saw them at all
Till there was you
Then there was music and wonderful roses
They tell me in sweet fragrant meadows
Of dawn and dew
There was love all around
But I never heard it singing
No, I never heard it at all
Till there was you
Then there was music and wonderful roses
They tell me in sweet fragrant meadows
Of dawn and dew
There was love all around
But I never heard it singing
No, I never heard it at all
Till there was you
Till there was you

Try to see it my way,
Do I have to keep on talking till I can't go on
While you see it your way,
Run the risk of knowing that our love may soon be gone.
We can work it out,
We can work it out.
Think of what you're saying.
You can get it wrong and still you think that it's alright.
Think of what I'm saying,
We can work it out and get it straight, or say good night.
We can work it out,
We can work it out.
Life is very short, and there's no time
For fussing and fighting, my friend.
I have always thought that it's a crime,
So I will ask you once again.
Try to see it my way,
Only time will tell if I am right or I am wrong.
While you see it your way
There's a chance that we may fall apart before too long.
We can work it out,
We can work it out.

Look what you're doing, I'm feeling blue and lonely
Would it be too much to ask you
What you're doing to me?
You got me running and there's no fun in it
Why should it be so much to ask of you
What you're doing to me?
I've been waiting here for you
Wond'ring what you're gonna do
Should you need a love that's true
It's me
Please stop your lying, you've got me crying, girl
Why should it be so much to ask of you

You don't realize how much I need you
Love you all the time and never leave you
Please come on back to me
I'm lonely as can be
I need you
Said you had a thing or two to tell me
How was I to know you would upset me?
I didn't realize as I looked in your eyes
You told me, oh yes, you told me, you don't want my lovin' anymore
That's when it hurt me and feeling like this I just can't go on anymore
Please remember how I feel about you
I could never really live without you
So, come on back and see just what you mean to me. I need you
But when you told me, you don't want my lovin' anymore
That's when it hurt me and feeling like this I just can't go on anymore
Please remember how I feel about you
I could never really live without you
So, come on back and see just what you mean to me
I need you
I need you
I need you

When I get older, losing my hair, many years from now,
Will you still be sending me a Valentine,birthday greetings, bottle of wine?
If I'd been out 'till quarter to three,would you lock the door?
Will you still need me, will you still feed me,
When I'm sixty-four?
Hmm------mmm---mmmh.
You'll be older, too.Aaah, and if you say the word, I could stay with you.
I could be handy, mending a fuse, when your lights have gone.
You can knit a sweater by the fireside, sunday mornings, go for a ride.
Doing the garden, digging the weeds, who could ask for more?
Will you still need me, will you still feed me, when I'm sixty four?
Every summer we can rent a cottage in the Isle of Wightif it's not to dear. We shall scrimp and save.
Ah, grandchildren on your knee, Vera, Chuck, and Dave.
Send me a postcard, drop me a line stating point of view.
Indicate precisely what you mean to say, yours sincerely wasting away.
Give me your answer, fill in a form, mine forever more.
Will you still need me, will you still feed me, when I'm sixty four?
by John Lennon/Paul McCartney

When I get older losing my hair
Many years from now
Will you still be sending me a valentine
Birthday greetings, bottle of wine?
If I'd been out till quarter to three
Would you lock the door?
Will you still need me, will you still feed me
When I'm sixty-four?
You'll be older too
And if you say the word
I could stay with you
I could be handy, mending a fuse
When your lights have gone
You can knit a sweater by the fireside
Sunday mornings go for a ride
Doing the garden, digging the weeds
Who could ask for more?
Will you still need me, will you still feed me
When I'm sixty-four?
Every summer we can rent a cottage in the Isle of Wight
If it's not too dear
We shall scrimp and save
Grandchildren on your knee
Vera, Chuck & Dave
Send me a postcard, drop me a line
Stating point of view
Indicate precisely what you mean to say
Yours sincerely, wasting away
Give me your answer, fill in a form
Mine for evermore
Will you still need me, will you still feed me
When I'm sixty-four?
Ho!

I look at you all see the love there that's sleeping
While my guitar gently weeps
I look at the floor and I see it needs sweeping
Still my guitar gently weeps
I don't know why nobody told you
How to unfold your love
I don't know how someone controlled you
They bought and sold you
I look at the world and I notice it's turning
While my guitar gently weeps
With every mistake we must surely be learning
Still my guitar gently weeps
Well?
I don't know how you were diverted
You were perverted too
I don't know how you were inverted
No one alerted you
I look at you all see the love there that's sleeping
While my guitar gently weeps
Look at you all
Still my guitar gently weeps
Oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, oh, ooh

Why why can't we love again?
Why why are you shy on love?
If you only knew how much I love you,
why can't you love me again?
Why why don't you open your heart?
Why why are we so far apart?
If you only knew how much I love you,
why can't you love me again?
I just want your loving arms around me, yeah,
I got to find a way to make you take me back.
Baby won't you tell me
why why why why are we so far apart?
Why why don't you open your heart?
If you only knew how much I love you,
why can't you love me again?
I just want your loving arms around me, yeah,
I got to find a way to make you take me back.
Baby won't you tell me
why why why why are we so far apart?
Why why don't you open your heart?
If you only knew how much I love you,
why can't you love me
why can't you love me
why can't you love me again?

Why don't we do it in the road? Mm
Why don't we do it in the road? Ah
Why don't we do it in the road? Mm

A little help from my friends
What would you think if I sang out of tune,
Would you stand up and walk out on me
Lend me your ears and I'll sing you a song,
And I'll try not to sing out of key.
I get by with a little help from my friends,
I get high with a little help from my friends,
Going to try with a little help from my friends.
What do I do when my love is away.
(Does it worry you to be alone)
How do I feel by the end of the day
(Are you sad because you're on your own)
No I get by with a little help from my friends,
Do you need anybody,
I need somebody to love.
Could it be anybody
I want somebody to love.
Would you believe in a love at first sight,
Yes I'm certain that it happens all the time.
What do you see when you turn out the light,
I can't tell you, but I know it's mine.
Oh I get by with a little help from my friends,
Do you need anybody,
I just need somebody to love,
Could it be anybody,
I want somebody to love.

With a little help from my friends.

We were talking about the space between us all
And the people who hide themselves behind a wall of illusion
Never glimpse the truth, then it's far too late, when they pass away
We were talking about the love we all could share
When we find it, to try our best to hold it there with our love
With our love, we could save the world, if they only knew
Try to realise it's all within yourself
No one else can make you change
And to see you're really only very small
And life flows on within you and without you
We were talking about the love that's gone so cold
And the people who gain the world and lose their soul
They don't know, they can't see, are you one of them?
When you've seen beyond yourself then you may find
Peace of mind is waiting there
And the time will come when you see we're all one
And life flows on within you and without you

Hold me close and tell me how you feel
Tell me love is real
Words of love you whisper soft and true
Darling I love you
Let me hear you say the words I long to hear
Darling when you're near
Words of love you whisper soft and true
Darling I love you

Yesterday, all my troubles seemed so far away
Now it looks as though they're here to stay
Oh, I believe in yesterday
Suddenly, I'm not half the man I used to be
There's a shadow hanging over me.
Oh, I yesterday came suddenly
Why she had to go I don't know she wouldn't say
I said something wrong, now I long for yesterday
Yesterday, love was such an easy game to play
Now I need a place to hide away
Oh, I believe in yesterday
Why she had to go I don't know she wouldn't say
I said something wrong, now I long for yesterday
Yesterday, love was such an easy game to play
Now I need a place to hide away
Oh, I believe in yesterday
Mm mm mm mm mm mm mm

I got something to say that might cause you pain
If I catch you talking to that boy again
I'm gonna let you down
And leave you flat
Because I told you before, oh
You can't do that
Well, it's the second time I've caught you talking to him
Do I have to tell you one more time, I think it's a sin
I think I'll let you down (Let you down)
Leave you flat (Gonna let you down and leave you flat)
Because I've told you before, oh
You can't do that
Everybody's green
Cos I'm the one who won your love
But if they'd seen
You're talking that way they'd laugh in my face
So please listen to me, if you wanna stay mine
I can't help my feelings, I'll go out of my mind
I'm gonna let you down (Let you down)
And leave you flat (Gonna let you down and leave you flat)
Because I've told you before, oh
You can't do that, oh
(You can't do that
You can't do that
You can't do that
You can't do that
You can't do that)
Everybody's green
Cos I'm the one who won your love

Though you've gone away this morning
You'll be back again tonight
Telling me there'll be no next time
If I don't just don't treat you right
You'll never leave me and you know it's true
Cos you like me too much and I like you
You've tried before to leave me
But you haven't got the nerve
To walk out and make me lonely
Which is all that I deserve
You'll never leave me and you know it's true
Cos you like me too much and I like you
I really do, and it's nice when you believe me
If you leave me
I will follow you and bring you back where you belong
Cos I could't really stand it
I admit that I was wrong
I wouldn't let you leave me cos it's true
Cos you like me too much and I like you
Cos you like me too much and I like you
I really do, and it's nice when you believe me

I don't like you but I love you
Seems that I'm always thinking of you
Oh oh oh you treat me badly, I love you madly
You've really got a hold on me
Baby I don't want you but I need you
Don't want to kiss you but I need to
Oh oh oh you do me wrong now, my love is strong now
You've really got a hold on me
Baby I love you and all I want you to do is just
Hold me, hold me, hold me, hold me
Tired of, tired of...
I want to leave you, don't want to stay here
Don't want to spend another day here
Oh oh oh I want to split now, I just can't quit now
You've really got a hold on me
Baby I love you and all I want you to do is just
Hold me please, hold me squeeze, hold me, hold me
You've really got a hold on me
You've really got a hold on me

When I call you up
Your line's engaged
I have had enough
So act your age
We have lost the time
That was so hard to find
And I will lose my mind
If you won't see me (You won't see me)
You won't see me (You won't see me)
I don't know why you
Should want to hide
But I can't get through
My hands are tied
I won't want to stay
I don't have much to say
But I can't turn away
And you won't see me (You won't see me)
You won't see me (You won't see me)
Time after time
You refuse to even listen
I wouldn't mind
If I knew what I was missing
Though the days are few
They're filled with tears
And since I lost you
It feels like years
Yes, it seems so long
Girl, since you've been gone
And I just can't go on
If you won't see me (You won't see me)
You won't see me (You won't see me)
Time after time
You refuse to even listen
I wouldn't mind

Yes, it seems so long
Girl, since you've been gone
And I just can't go on
If you won't see me (You won't see me)
You won't see me (You won't see me)

You're going to lose that girl
You're going to lose that girl
If you don't take her out tonight
She's going to change her mind
And I will take her out tonight
And I will treat her kind
You're going to lose that girl
You're going to lose that girl
If you don't treat her right, my friend
You're going to find her gone
Cos I will treat her right, and then
You'll be the lonely one
You're going to lose that girl
You're going to lose that girl
I'll make a point
Of taking her away from you, yeah
The way you treat her what else can I do?
You're going to lose that girl

And I will treat her kind
You're going to lose that girl
You're going to lose that girl
You're going to lose that girl

I should have known better with a girl like you
That I would love everything that you do
And I do, hey, hey, hey, and I do
Whoa, oh, I never realized what a kiss could be
This could only happen to me
Can't you see, can't you see
That when I tell you that I love you, oh
You're gonna say you love me too, oh
And when I ask you to be mine
You're gonna say you love me too
So I should have realized a lot of things before
If this is love you've got to give me more
Give me more, hey hey hey, give me more
Whoa, oh, I never realized what a kiss could be
This could only happen to me
Can't you see, can't you see
That when I tell you that I love you, oh
You're gonna say you love me too, oh
And when I ask you to be mine
You're gonna say you love me too
You love me too, you love me too
You love me too

Here I stand head in hand
Turn my face to the wall
If she's gone I can't go on
Feeling two-foot small
Everywhere people stare
Each and every day
I can see them laugh at me
And I hear them say
Hey you've got to hide your love away
Hey you've got to hide your love away
How can I even try
I can never win
Hearing them, seeing them
In the state I'm in
How could she say to me
Love will find a way
Gather round all you clowns
Let me hear you say
Hey you've got to hide your love away
Hey you've got to hide your love away

I want to tell you
My head is filled with things to say
When you're here
All those words, they seem to slip away
When I get near you
The games begin to drag me down
It's alright
I'll make you maybe next time around
But if I seem to act unkind
It's only me, it's not my mind
That is confusing things
I want to tell you
I feel hung up but I don't know why
I don't mind
I could wait forever, I've got time
Sometimes I wish I knew you well,
Then I could speak my mind and tell you
Maybe you'd understand
I want to tell you
I feel hung up but I don't know why
I don't mind
I could wait forever, I've got time, I've got time, I've got time

I want to tell you

But I came back again
I love you so
I'm the one who wants you
Yes, I'm the one
Who wants you, oh ho, oh ho, oh
You could find better things to do
Than to break my heart again
This time I will try to show that I'm
Not trying to pretend
I thought that you would realize
That if I ran away from you
That you would want me too
But I got a big surprise
Oh ho, oh ho, oh

Than to break my heart again
This time I will try to show that I'm
Not trying to pretend
I wanna go but I hate to leave you,
You know I hate to leave you , oh ho, oh ho, oh
You, if you break my heart I'll go
But I'll be back again

I've got every reason on earth to be mad
Cos I've just lost the only girl I had
And if I could get my way
I'd get myself locked up today
But I can't so I cry instead
I've got a chip on my shoulder that's bigger than my feet
I can't talk to people that I meet
And if I could see you now
I'd try to make you sad somehow
But I can't so I cry instead
Don't want to cry when there's people there
I get shy when they start to stare
I'm gonna hide myself away, ay hay
But I'll come back again someday
And when I do you'd better hide all the girls
I'm gonna break their hearts all 'round the world
Yes, I'm gonna break them in two
And show you what your loving man can do
Until then I'll cry instead
Don't want to cry when there's people there
I get shy when they start to stare
I'm gonna hide myself away, ay hay
But I'll come back again someday

Cos I'm gonna break their hearts all 'round the world
Yes, I'm gonna break them in two
And show you what your loving man can do
Until then I'll cry instead

One day you'll look to see I've gone
For tomorrow may rain, so I'll follow the sun
Some day you'll know I was the one
But tomorrow may rain, so I'll follow the sun
And now the time has come

In this world there's nothing I would rather do
I've discovered I'm in love with you
Cos I'm happy just to dance with you

I'm looking through you, where did you go?
I thought I knew you, what did I know?
You don't look different, but you have changed
I'm looking through you, you're not the same
Your lips are moving, I cannot hear
Your voice is soothing, but the words aren't clear
You don't sound different, I've learned the game
I'm looking through you, you're not the same
Why, tell me why, did you not treat me right?
Love has a nasty habit of disappearing overnight
You're thinking of me, the same old way
You were above me, but not today
The only difference is you're down there
I'm looking through you, and you're nowhere
Why, tell me why, did you not treat me right?
Love has a nasty habit of disappearing overnight
I'm looking through you, where did you go
I thought I knew you, what did I know
You don't look different, but you have changed
I'm looking through you, you're not the same
Yeah
Oh baby I'm changed
Ah I'm looking through you
Yeah I'm looking through you

I'm a loser
I'm a loser
And I'm not what I appear to be
Of all the love I have won or have lost
There is one love I should never have crossed
She was a girl in a million, my friend
I should have known she would win in the end
I'm a loser
And I lost someone who's near to me
I'm a loser
And I'm not what I appear to be
Although I laugh and I act like a clown
Beneath this mask I am wearing a frown
My tears are falling like rain from the sky
Is it for her or myself that I cry
I'm a loser
And I lost someone who's near to me
I'm a loser
And I'm not what I appear to be
What have I done to deserve such a fate
I realize I have left it too late
And so it's true, pride comes before a fall
I'm telling you so that you won't lose all
I'm a loser
And I lost someone who's near to me
I'm a loser
And I'm not what I appear to be

When I wake up early in the morning
Lift my head, I'm still yawning
When I'm in the middle of a dream
Stay in bed, float up stream (Float up stream)
Please, don't wake me, no, don't shake me
Leave me where I am, I'm only sleeping
Everybody seems to think I'm lazy
I don't mind, I think they're crazzy
Running everywhere at such a speed
Till they find there's no need (There's no need)
Please, don't spoil my day, I'm miles away
And after all I'm only sleeping
Keeping an eye on the world going by my window
Taking my time
Lying there and staring at the ceiling
Waiting for a sleepy feeling...
Please, don't spoil my day, I'm miles away
And after all I'm only sleeping
Ooh yeah
Keeping an eye on the world going by my window
Taking my time
When I wake up early in the morning
Lift my head, I'm still yawning
When I'm in the middle of a dream
Stay in bed, float up stream (Float up stream)
Please, don't wake me, no, don't shake me
Leave me where I am, I'm only sleeping

I'm so tired, I haven't slept a wink
I'm so tired, my mind is on the blink
I wonder should I get up and fix myself a drink
No, no, no
I'm so tired I don't know what to do
I'm so tired my mind is set on you
I wonder should I call you but I know what you'd do
You'd say I'm putting you on
But it's no joke, it's doing me harm
You know I can't sleep, I can't stop my brain
You know it's three weeks, I'm going insane
You know I'd give you everything I've got
For a little peace of mind
I'm so tired, I'm feeling so upset
Although I'm so tired I'll have another cigarette
And curse Sir Walter Raleigh
He was such a stupid get
You'd say I'm putting you on
But it's no joke, it's doing me harm
You know I can't sleep, I can't stop my brain
You know it's three weeks, I'm going insane
You know I'd give you everything I've got
For a little peace of mind
I'd give you everything I've got
For a little peace of mind
I'd give you everything I've got
For a little peace of mind
[Monsieur, Monsieur, Monsieur, how about another one?]

Oh no, oh no, oh no

I've got a feeling
All these years I've been wandering around
Wondering how come nobody told me
All that I was looking for was somebody
Who looked like you
I've got a feeling, that keeps me on my toes
Oh yeah, oh yeah
I've got a feeling, I think that everybody knows
Oh yeah, oh yeah, oh yeah

I've just seen a face
I can't forget the time or place
Where we just meet
She's just the girl for me
And want all the world to see
We've met, mmm-mmm-mmm-m'mmm-mmm
Had it been another day
I might have looked the other way
And I'd have never been aware
But as it is I'll dream of her
Tonight, di-di-di-di'n'di
Falling, yes I am falling
And she keeps calling
Me back again
I have never known
The like of this, I've been alone
And I have missed things
And kept out of sight
But other girls were never quite
Like this, da-da-n'da-da'n'da
Falling, yes I am falling
And she keeps calling
Me back again
Falling, yes I am falling

Especially when you're standing there
Wearing diamond and rings (Oh oh)
You think I'm soft in the head
Well try someone softer instead anything
It's not so funny

[All too much!]
It's all too much
It's all too much
When I look into your eyes, your love is there for me
And the more I go inside, the more there is to see
It's all too much for me to take
The love that's shining all around you
Everywhere, it's what you make
For us to take, it's all too much
Floating down the stream of time from life to life with me
Makes no difference where you are or where you'd like to be
It's all too much for me to take
The love that's shining all around here
All the world is birthday cake
So take a piece but not too much
Sail me on a silver sun, where I know that I'm free
Show me that I'm everywhere, and get me home for tea
It's all to much for me to see
The love that's shining all around here
The more I learn, the less I know
But what I do is all too much
It's all too much for me to take
The love that's shining all around you
Everywhere, it's what you make
For us to take, it's all too much
It's too much
Ah, it's too much
With your long blond hair and your eyes of blue
With your long blond hair and your eyes of blue
You're too much, ah
We all get too much
Too much, too much, too much
Too much a, too much a, too much a

IT'S FOR YOU
WRITERS JOHN LENNON, PAUL McCARTNEY
I'd say some day
I'm bound to give my hert away
When I do
It's for you
It's for you
It's for you
You love true love
Seems to be all I'm thinking of
But it's true
It's for you
They said that love was a lie
Told me that I should never try
To find somebody who'd be kind
Kind to only me
So I just tell them they're right
Who wants a fight
Tell them I quite agree
Nobody'd love me
Then I look at you
And it's for you
It's for you
It's for you
Love comes love shows
I give my heart and no one knows
That I do
It's for you
It's for you

I get high when I see you go by
My oh my
When you sigh, my, my inside just flies
Butterflies
Why am I so shy when I'm beside you?
It's only love and that is all
Why should I feel the way I do?
It's only love, and that is all
But it's so hard loving you
Is it right that you and I should fight
Every night?
Just the sight of you makes nighttime bright
Very bright
Haven't I the right to make it up girl?
It's only love and that is all
Why should I feel the way I do?
It's only love, and that is all
But it's so hard loving you
Yes it's so hard loving you, loving you

There's nothing you can do that can't be done
Nothing you can sing that can't be sung
Nothing you can say, but you can learn how to play the game
It's easy!
Nothing you can make that can't be made
No one you can save that can't be saved
Nothing you can do, but you can learn how to be you in time
It'easy!
Nothing you can know that isn't known
Nothing you can see that isn't shown
Nowhere you can be that isn't where you were meant to be
It'easy!
All you need is Love
Love is all you need.

Hey Jude, don't make it bad.
Take a sad song and make it better.
Remember to let her into your heart,
Then you can start to make it better.
Hey Jude, don't be afraid.
You were made to go out and get her.
The minute you let her under your skin,
Then you begin to make it better.
And anytime you feel the pain, hey Jude, refrain,
Don't carry the world upon your shoulders.
For well you know that it's a fool who plays it cool
By making his world a little colder.
Hey Jude, don't let me down.
You have found her, now go and get her.
Remember to let her into your heart,
Then you can start to make it better.
So let it out and let it in, hey Jude, begin,
You're waiting for someone to perform with.
And don't you know that it's just you, hey Jude, you'll do,
The movement you need is on your shoulder.
Hey Jude, don't make it bad.
Take a sad song and make it better.
Remember to let her under your skin,
Then you'll begin to make it
Better better better better better better, oh.
Naaa na na nananana, nanananaaa  hey Jude...  (repeat X number of times)

When I find myself in times of trouble
Mother Mary comes to me
Speaking words of wisdom, let it be
And in my hour of darknes
She is standing right in front of me
Speaking words of wisdom, let it be
LET IT BE, LET IT BE, LET IT BE, LET IT BE
WHISPER WORDS OF WISDOM, LET IT BE
And when the broken hearted peaple
living in the world agree
there will be an answer, let it be
for though they maybe parted
there is still a chance that they will see
there will be an answer, let it be
LET IT BE, LET IT BE...............
THERE WILL BE AN ANSWER, LET IT BE
And when the night is cloudy
there is still a light that shines on me
shine until tommorow, let it be
I wake up to the sound of music
Mother Mary comes to me
Speaking words of wisdom, let it be
Refrain

If she's gone I can't go on, feeling two foot small
Everywhere people stare each and every way
I can see them laugh at me and I hear them say ay ay
Hey you got to hide your love away
Hey you got to hide your love away
How can I even try, I can never win
Hearing them seeing them in the state I'm in
How could she say to me love will find away
Gather round all you clown, let me hear you say ay ay
Hey you got to hide your love away
Hey you got to hide your love away

Each time I look into your eyes
I see that there a heaven lies
and as I look
I see the love of the loved.
Someday they'll see that from the start
my place has been deep in your heart.
And in your heart
I see the love of the loved.
Though I said it all before
I will say it more and more,
now that I'm really sure
you love me.
And I know that from today
I'll see it in the way
that you look at me
and say ah you love me.
So let it rain, I'll never care?
Deep in your heart, I'd still be there.
And when I'm there
I see the love of the loved.
Though I said it all before
I will say it more and more,

you love me.

I took my troubles down to Madame Rue.
You know that gypsy with the gold capped tooth
She's got a pad down on 34th and Vine,
Selling little bottles of Love Potion #9.
I told her that I was a flop with chicks.
I've been disgraced since 1956.
She looked at my palm and she made a magic sign.
She said what you need is Love Potion #9.
She bent down and turned around and gave me a wink.
She said I'm gonna make it up right here in the sink.
It smelled like turpentine, and looked like Indian ink.
I held my nose, I closed my eyes, I took a drink!
I didn't know if it was day or night.
I started kissing everything in sight.
But when I kissed a cop down on 34th and Vine.
He broke my little bottle of Love Potion #9.
(instrumental)

Lee Peters: But now, John has his work cut out on the next one, as he takes his guitar on and off his neck and pulls the harmonica in and out of his face.
John: Harp. It's a harp.
Lee: What? Harp?
John: The harp. 'Cause I'm playing the harp on this one.
Lee: Playing the harp?
John: Harmonica I play on "Love Me Do," harp, on this one, little goes in the orang.
Lee: But it goes in and out? Do you wanna do this announcement? Well, go on, you go ahead, no, it's all right. Tell them. Tell them about the next song.
John: Oh, er, we'd like to carry on with Chuck Berry's "I Gotta Find My Baby." Don't know where she's been, pardon, hello? Love these goon shows.

Picture yourself in a boat on a river,
With tangerine trees and marmalade skies
Somebody calls you, you answer quite slowly,
A girl with kaleidoscope eyes.
Cellophane flowers of yellow and green,
Towering over your head.
Look for the girl with the sun in her eyes,
And she's gone.
Lucy in the sky with diamonds.
Follow her down to a bridge by a fountain
Where rocking horse people eat marshmellow pies,
Everyone smiles as you drift past the flowers,
That grow so incredibly high.
Newpaper taxis appear on the shore,
Waiting to take you away.
Climb in the back with your head in the clouds,
And you're gone.
Lucy in the sky with diamonds,
Picture yourself on a train in a station,
With plasticine porters with looking glass ties,
Suddenly someone is there at the turnstyle,
The girl with the kaleidoscope eyes.

Oh dirty Maggie Mai they have taken her away
And she never walk down Lime Street anymore
Oh the judge he guilty found her
Of robbing home a pounder
That dirty no good robbin' Maggie Mae
Just a part of Liverpool
She earned a term with two
Two pounds ten a week, that was my pay...

Si no te conociera, si no estuviera aquí
No habría encontrado la alegría de vivir
Enciendes melodías que brotan en tu voz
Que calman y apaciguan mi lucha interior
Y aunque somos diferentes, nos une una obsesión
Cantar es nuestra vida y mi música es tu voz
Cuenta con mi vida que hoy la doy por ti
Mi pasión quiero compartir
A tu lado me siento seguro
A tu lado no dudo
A tu lado yo puedo volar
A tu lado brilla mi estrella
A tu lado mi sueño se hará por fin realidad
A tu lado...
Estamos hoy unidos
Cantando esta canción
Mañana separados
Pero unido está el corazón
Y aunque somos diferentes, nos une una obsesión
Cantar es nuestra vida y mi música es tu voz

This happened once before
When I came to your door
No reply
They said it wasn't you
But I saw you peep through your window
I saw the lie, I saw the lie
I know that you saw me
As I looked up to your face
I tried to telephone
They said you were not home
That's a lie
Cos I know where you've been
I saw you walk in your door
I nearly died, I nearly died
Cos you walked hand in hand
With another man in my place
If I were you'd realise that I
Love you more than any other guy
And I'll forgive the lies that I
Heard before when you gave me no reply
I've tried to telephone
They said you were not home
That's a lie
Cos I know where you've been
I saw you walk in your door
I nearly died, I nearly died
Cos you walked hand in hand
With another man in my place
No reply, no reply

(Beatles were never recorded this song, this made Peter and Gordon)
Nobody I know could love me more than you.
You can give me so much love it seems untrue.
Listen to the bird who sings it to the tree
and then when you've heard him see if you agree.
Nobody I know could love you more than me.
Ev'rywhere I go the sun comes shining through.
Ev'ryone I know is sure it shines for you.
Even in my dreams I look into your eyes,
Suddenly it seems I've found a paradise.
Ev'rywhere I go the sun comes shining through.
It means so much to be a part of a heart of a wonderful one.
When other lovers are gone, we'll live on.
We'll live on.
Nobody I know could love me more than you.
You can give me so much love it seems untrue.
Listen to the bird who sings it to the tree
and then when you've heard him see if you agree.
Nobody I know could love you more than me.

As I was slowly passing
an orphan's home one day,
I stopped for just a little while
to watch the children play.
Alone a boy was standing
and when I asked him why,
he turned with eyes that could not see
and he began to cry.
I'm nobody's child,
I'm nobody's child.
Just like the flowers
I'm growing wild.
I got no mummy's kisses
I got no daddy's smile.
Nobody wants me,
I'm nobody's child.
No mummy's arms to hold me
or sue me when I cry,
'cos sometimes I feel so lonesome
I wish that I could die.
I'll walk the streets of heaven
where all blinds can see.
And just like for the other kids
it will be a home for me.
I'm nobody's child,
I'm nobody's child.
Just like the flowers
I'm growing wild.
I got no mummy's kisses
I got no daddy's smile.
Nobody wants me,
I'm nobody's child.

Here comes the sun, here comes the sun,
And I say it's all right
Little darling, it's been a long cold lonely winter
Little darling, it feels like years since it's been here
Here comes the sun, here comes the sun
And I say it's all right
Little darling, the smiles returning to the faces
Little darling, it seems like years since it's been here
Here comes the sun, here comes the sun
And I say it's all right
Sun, sun, sun, here it comes...
Sun, sun, sun, here it comes...
Sun, sun, sun, here it comes...
Sun, sun, sun, here it comes...
Sun, sun, sun, here it comes...
Little darling, I feel that ice is slowly melting
Little darling, it seems like years since it's been clear
Here comes the sun, here comes the sun,
And I say it's all right
It's all right

I once had a girl or should I say she once had me
She showed me her room, isn't it good Norwegian wood
She asked me to stay and she told me to sit anywhere
So I looked around and I noticed there wasn't a chair
I sat on a rug biding my time drinking her wine
We talked until two and then she said: 'It's time for bed'
She told me she worked in the morning and started to laugh
I told her I didn't and crawled off to sleep in the bath
And when I awoke I was alone, this bird had flown
So I lit a fire, isn't it good Norwegian wood

I once had a girl, or should I say, she once had me
She showed me her room, isn't it good, norwegian wood?
She asked me to stay and she told me to sit anywhere
So I looked around and I noticed there wasn't a chair
I sat on the rug, biding my time, drinking her wine
We talked until two and then she said, "It's time for bed"
She told me she worked in the morning and started to laugh
I told her I didn't and crawled off to sleep in the bath
And when I awoke I was alone, this bird had flown
So I lit a fire, isn't it good, norwegian wood?

You know you made me cry
I see no use in wondering why
I cry for you
And now you've changed your mind
I see no reason to change mine
I cry it's through, oh
You're giving me the same old line
I'm wondering why
You hurt me then
You're back again
No, no, no, not a second time
You know you made me cry
I see no use in wondering why
I cry for you, yea
And now you've changed your mind
I see no reason to change mine
I cry it's through, oh
You're giving me the same old line
I'm wondering why
You hurt me then
You're back again
No, no, no, not a second time
Not a second time
Not the second time
No, no, no, no, no
No, no no

Not guilty
For getting in your way, while you try to steal the day
Not guilty
I'm not nodding for the rest, I'm
not trying to steal you vest
I end up trying to be smart I only want what I can get
I'm really sorry for your aging head, but like you heard me said
Not guilty
Though you signing me a writ, while I'm trying to do my bit
I don't expect to take your hoard I only want what I can get
I'm really sorry that you're underfed, but like you heard me said
Not guilty
Not guilty
For looking like a freak, making friends with every Sikh
Not guilty
For leading you astray, on the road to Masalay
I won't upset the apple cart I only want what I can get
I'm really sorry that you've been mislead, but like you heard me said
Not guilty

If you're listening to this song
You may think the chords are going wrong
But they're not;
He just wrote it like that.
It doesn't really matter what chords I play
What words I say or time of day it is
As it's only a Northern song
It doesn't really matter what clothes I wear
Or how I fare or if my hair is brown
When it's only a Northern song.
When you're listening late at night
You may think the band are not quite right
But they are, they just play it like that
It doesn't really matter what chords I play
What words I say or time of day it is
As it's only a Northern song.
It doesn't really matter what clothes I wear
Or how I fare or if my hair is brown
When it's only a Northern song.
If you think the harmony
Is a little dark and out of key
You're correct, there's nobody there.
It doesn't really matter what chords I play
What words I say or time of day it is
And I told you there's no one there.

I found it out
What love is all about
And every day
It sure lets out
I see my baby
I get weak in my knees
There's nothing shaking
But the leaves on the trees
My pappie told me
There'd be times like these
There's nothing shaking
But the leaves on the trees
We meet the gang
And go to rocking Joes
The cats are something
On the heels and toes
I grab my baby
Tried to give her a squeeze
There's nothing shaking
But the leaves on the trees
Well why must she be
Such a doggone tease?
There's nothing shaking
But the leaves on the trees
She's got a way
That makes me act like a fool
Spent my money
Then she plays me cool
I begged her for kisses
On my bended knees
Oh won't you give me
Some loving, baby
Please please please
Though I keep trying hard
To make her mine
One day the wind will blow
And the sun will shine
Till that time
She puts my heart at ease
There's nothing shaking
But the leaves on the trees
She locked my heart
And threw away the keys
There's nothing shaking
But the leaves on the trees, yeah
She's got a way
That makes me act like a fool
Spent my money
Then she plays me cool
I'm begging for her kisses
On my bended knees
Oh won't you give me
Some of your loving, baby
Please please please
Though I keep trying hard
To make her mine
One day the wind will blow
And the sun will shine
Till that time
She puts my heart at ease
There's nothing shaking
But the leaves on the trees
She locked my heart
And threw away the keys
There's nothing shaking
But the leaves on the trees
There's nothing shaking
But the leaves on the trees
There's nothing shaking
But the leaves on the trees
There's nothing shaking
But the leaves on the trees

He's a real nowhere Man,
Sitting in his Nowhere Land,
Making all his nowhere plans
for nobody.
Doesn't kave a point of view,
Knows not where he's going to,
Isn't he a bit like you and me
Nowhere Man, please listen,
You don't know what you're missing,
Nowhere Man, the world is at your command.
He's as blind as he can be,
Just sees what he wants to see,
Nowhere Man can you see me at all
Doesn't kave a point of view,
Knows not where he's going to,
Isn't he a bit like you and me
Nowhere Man, don't worry,
Take your time, don't hurry,
Leave it all till somebody else
lend you a hand.
He's a real Nowhere Man,
Sitting in his Nowhere Land,
Making all his nowhere plans
For nobody.

I'd like to be under the sea
In an octopus's garden in the shade
He'd let us in, knows where we've been
In his octopus's garden in the shade
I'd ask my friends to come and see
An octopus's garden with me
I'd like to be under the sea
In an octopus's garden in the shade
We would be warm below the storm
In our little hideaway beneath the waves
Resting our head on the sea bed
In an octopus's garden near a cave
We would sing and dance around
Because we know we can't be found
I'd like to be under the sea
In an octopus's garden in the shade
We would shout and swim about
The coral that lies beneath the waves
(Lies beneath the ocean waves)
Oh what joy for every girl and boy
Knowing they're happy and they're safe
(Happy and they're safe)
We would be so happy you and me
No one there to tell us what to do
I'd like to be under the sea
In an octopus's garden with you
In an octopus's garden with you
In an octopus's garden with you

Oh! Darling, please believe me
I'll never do you no harm
Believe me when I tell you
I'll never do you no harm
Oh! Darling, if you leave me
I'll never make it alone
Believe me when I thank you, ooo
Don't ever leave me alone
When you told me
You didn't need me anymore
Well you know I nearly broke down and cried
When you told me
You didn't need me anymore
Well you know I nearly broke down and died
Oh! Darling, if you leave me

I call your name but you're not there
Was I to blame for being unfair
Oh I can't sleep at night
Since you've been gone
I never weep at night
I can't go on
Don't you know I can't take it
I don't know who can
I'm not goin' to mayayake it
I'm not that kind of man
Oh I can't sleep at night
But just the same
I never weep at night
I call your name

I want a love that's right but right is only half of what's wrong
I want a short haired girl who sometimes wears it twice as long
Now I'm stepping out this old brown shoe, baby, I'm in love with you
I'm so glad you came here, it won't be the same now, I'm telling you
You know you pick me up from where some try to drag me down
And when I see your smile replace every thoughtless frown
Got me escaping from this zoo, baby, I'm in love with you
I'm so glad you came here, it won't be the same now when I'm with you
If I grow up I'll be a singer wearing rings on every finger
Not worrying what they or you say I'll live and love and maybe someday
Who knows, baby, you may comfort me
I may appear to be imperfect, my love is something you can't reject
I'm changing faster than the weather if you and me should get together
Who knows, baby, you may comfort me
I want that love of yours, to miss that love is something I'd hate
I'll make an early start, I'm making sure that I'm not late
For you sweet top lip I'm in the queue, baby, I'm in love with you
I'm so glad you came here, it won't be the same now when I'm with you
I'm so glad you came here, it won't be the same now when I'm with you

My baby says she's trav'ling on the one after 909
I said move over honey I'm travelling on that line
I said move over once, move over twice
Come on baby don't be cold as ice
I said I'm trav'ling on the one after 909
I begged her not to go and I begged her on my bended knees
You're only fooling around, you're fooling around with me
I said move over once, move over twice
Come on baby don't be cold as ice
I said I'm trav'ling on the one after 909
I got my bag, run to the station
Railman says you've got the the wrong location
I got my bag, run right home
Then I find I've got the number wrong
Well I said I'm trav'ling on the one after 909
I said move over honey I'm travelling on that line
I said move over once, move over twice
Come on baby don't be cold as ice
I said I'm trav'ling on the one after 909
I got my bag, run to the station

I got my bag, run right home

I said we're trav'ling on the one after 90
I said we're trav'ling on the one after 90
I said we're trav'ling on the one after 909

In Penny Lane there is a barber showing photographs
Of every head he's had the pleasure to have know.
And all the people that come and go
Stop and say hello.
On the corner is a banker with a motorcar,
The little children laugh at him behind his back.
And the banker never wears a mack
In the pouring rain, very strange.
Penny Lane is in my ears and in my eyes.
There beneath the blue suburban skies
I sit, and meanwhile back
In Penny Lane there is a fireman with an hourglass
And in his pocket is a portrait of the Queen.
He likes to keep his fire engine clean,
It's a clean machine.
Penny Lane is in my ears and in my eyes.
A four of fish and finger pies
In summer, meanwhile back
Behind the shelter in the middle of a roundabout
The pretty nurse is selling poppies from a tray
And tho' she feels as if she's in a play
She is anyway.
In Penny Lane the barber shaves another customer,
We see the banker sitting waiting for a trim.
And then the fireman rushes in
From the pouring rain, very strange.
Penny lane is in my ears and in my eyes.
There beneath the blue suburban skies
I sit, and meanwhile back.
Penny lane is in my ears and in my eyes.
There beneath the blue suburban skies,
Penny Lane.

Have you seen the little piggies
Crawling in the dirt?
And for all the little piggies
Life is getting worse
Always having dirt to play around in
Have you seen the bigger piggies
In their starched white shirts?
You will find the bigger piggies
Stirring up the dirt
Always have clean shirts to play around in
In their styes with all their backing
They don't care what goes on around
In their eyes there's something lacking
What they need's a damn good whacking
Everywhere there's lots of piggies
Living piggy lives
You can see them out for dinner
With their piggy wives
Clutching forks and knives to eat their bacon

I don't want to spoil the party so I'll go
I would hate my disappointment to show
There's nothing for me here so I will disappear
If she turns up while I'm gone please let me know
I've had a drink or two and I don't care
There's no fun in what I do if she's not there
I wonder what went wrong I've waited far too long
I think I'll take a walk and look for her
Though tonight she's made me sad
I still love her
If I find her I'll be glad
I still love her

C'mon (C'mon), c'mon (C'mon), c'mon (C'mon), c'mon (C'mon)
Please please me, whoa yeah, like I please you
I don't wanna sound complaining
But you know there's always rain in my heart (In my heart)
I do all the pleasing with you, it's so hard to reason
With you, whoah yeah, why do you make me blue
Last night I said these words to my girl
I know you never even try, girl
C'mon (C'mon), c'mon (C'mon), c'mon (C'mon), c'mon (C'mon)
Please please me, whoa yeah, like I please you
(Me) Whoa yeah, like I please you
(Me) Whoa yeah, like I please you

Well you should see Polythene Pam
She's so good-looking but she looks like a man
Well you should see her in drag dressed in her polythene bag
Yes you should see Polythene Pam
Yeah yeah yeah
Get a dose of her in jackboots and kilt
She's killer-diller when she's dressed to the hilt
She's the kind of a girl that makes the "News of the World"
Yes you could say she was attractively built
Yeah yeah yeah

If the rain comes they run and hide their heads
They might as well be dead
If the rain comes, if the rain comes
When the sun shines they slip into the shade
(When the sun shines down)
And drink their lemonade
(When the sun shines down)
When the sun shines, when the sun shines
Rain, I don't mind
Shine, the weather's fine
I can show you that when it starts to rain
(When the rain comes down)
Everything's the same
(When the rain comes down)
I can show you, I can show you
Rain, I don't mind
Shine, the weather's fine
Can you hear me, that when it rains and shines
(When it rains and shines)
It's just a state of mind?
(When it rains and shines)
Can you hear me, can you hear me?
Sdaeh rieht edih dna nur yeht semoc niar eht fI

(Rain)

All my little plans and schemes
Lost like some forgotten dream
Seems like all I really was doing
Was waiting for you
Just like little girls and boys
Playing with their little toys
Seems like all they really were doing
Was waiting for you
Don't need to be alone
No need to be alone
It's real love
It's real, yes it's real love
It's real
From this moment on I know
Exactly where my life will go
Seems that all I really was doing
Was waiting for love
Don't need to be afraid
No need to be afraid
It's real love
It's real, yes it's real love
It's real
Thought I'd been in love before,
But in my heart I wanted more
Seems like all I really was doing
Was waiting for you
Don't need to be alone
No need to be alone
It's real love
Yes it's real, yes it's real love
It's real, yes it's real love...

Just let me hear some of that rock and roll music
Any old way you choose it
It's got a back beat, you can't lose it
Any old time you use it
It's gotta be rock and roll music
If you wanna dance with me
If you wanna dance with me
I've got no kick against modern jazz
Unless they try to play it too darn fast
And lose the beauty of the melody
Until they sound just like a symphony
That's why I go for that that rock and roll music
Any old way you choose it
It's got a back beat, you can't lose it
Any old time you use it
It's gotta be rock and roll music
If you wanna dance with me
If you wanna dance with me
I took my loved one over across the tracks
So she can hear my man awail a sax
I must admit they have a rocking band
Man, they were blowing like a hurricane
That's why I go for that that rock and roll music
Any old way you choose it
It's got a back beat, you can't lose it
Any old time you use it
It's gotta be rock and roll music
If you wanna dance with me
If you wanna dance with me
Way down South they had a jubilee
The jokey folks they had a jamboree
They're drinking home brew from a water cup
The folks dancing there are all shook up
And started playing that that rock and roll music
Any old time you use it
It's got a back beat, you can't lose it
Any old time you use it
It's gotta be rock and roll music
If you wanna dance with me
If you wanna dance with me
Don't care to hear them play a tango
And In The Mood they take a mambo
It's way to early for a congo
So keep a rocking that piano
That's why I go for that that rock and roll music
Any old time you use it
It's got a back beat, you can't lose it
Any old time you use it
Gotta be rock and roll music
If you wanna dance with me
If you wanna dance with me

Well gonna write a little letter
Gonna mail it to my local D.J.
It's a rocking little record
I want my jockey to play
Roll over Beethoven
I gotta hear it again today
You know my temperature's rising
And the jukebox's blows a fuse
My hearts beating rhythm
And my soul keeps singing the blues
Roll over Beethoven
And tell Tchaikovsky the news
I got a rocking pneumonia
I need a shot of rhythm and blues
I think I got it off the writer
Sittin' down by the rhythm review
Roll over Beethoven
We're rockin' in two by two
Well if you fell you like it
Well get your lover and reel and rock it
Roll it over and move on up
Just jump around and reel and rock it
Roll it over
Roll over Beethoven
A rocking in two by two, oh
Well early in the morning
I'm a giving you the warning
Don't you step on my blue suede showes
Hey little little
Gonna play my fiddle
Ain't got nothing to lose
Roll over Beethoven
And tell Tchaikovsky the news
You know she winks like a glow worm
Dance like a spinning top
She got a crazy partner
Oughta see them reel an rock
Long as she's got a dime
The music will never stop
Roll over Beethoven
Roll over Beethoven
Roll over Beethoven
Roll over Beethoven
Roll over Beethoven
And dig these rhythm and blues

They're gonna put me in the movies
They're gonna make a big star out of me
We'll make a film about a man that's sad and lonely
And all I gotta so is act naturally
Well, I'll bet you I'm gonna be a big star
Might win an Oscar you can never tell
The movies gonna make me a big star
'Cause I can play the part so well
Well I hope you come and see me in the movies
Then I know that you will plainly see
The biggest fool that ever hit the big time
And all I gotta do is act naturally
We'll make the scene about a man that's sad and lonely
And beggin down upon his bended knee
I'll play the part but I won't need rehearsal
All I gotta do is act naturally
Well, I'll bet you I'm gonna be a big star
Might win an Oscar you can never tell
The movies gonna make me a big star
'Cause I can play the part so well
Well I hope you come and see me in the movies
Then I know that you will plainly see
The biggest fool that ever hit the big time
And all I gotta do is act naturally

Creme tangerine and montelimat
A ginger sling with a pineapple heart
A coffee dessert, yes, you know it's good news
But you'll have to have them all pulled out
After the Savoy truffle
Cool cherry cream and a nice apple tart
I feel your taste all the time we're apart
Coconut fudge really blows down those blues
But you'll have to have them all pulled out
After the Savoy truffle
You might not feel it now
But when the pain cuts through
You're going to know and how
The sweat is going to fill your head
When it becomes too much
You're going to shout aloud
But you'll have to have them all pulled out
After the Savoy truffle.
You know that what you eat you are
But what is sweet now, turns so sour
We all know Ob-La-Di-Bla-Da
But can you show me, where you are?
Creme tangerine and montelimat
A ginger sling with a pineapple heart
A coffee dessert--yes you know its good news
But you'll have to have them all pulled out
After the Savoy truffle
Yes you'll have to have them all pulled out
After the Savoy truffle

The leaves of brown
came tumbling down,
remember in september in the rain.
The sun went out
just like a light,
remember in september in the rain.
To every word
of love I heard you whisper
the raindrops seems
to play a sweet refrain.
Thought it's spring,
to me it's still september,
oh that september in the rain.
To every word
of love I heard you whisper
the raindrops seems
to play a sweet refrain.
Thought it's spring,
to me it's still september,
oh that september in the rain.
I said I said it's september in the rain.
Ah september in the rain.

Sgt. Pepper's lonely, Sgt. Pepper's lonely
Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band

It was twenty years ago today,
Sgt. Pepper taught the band to play
They've been going in and out of style
But they're guaranteed to raise a smile.
So may I introduce to you
The act you've known for all these years,
Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band.
We're Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band,

It's certainly a thrill.
You're such a lovely audience,
We'd like to take you home with us,
We'd love to take you home.
I don't really want to stop the show,
But I thought that you might like to know,
That the singer's going to sing a song,
And he wants you all to sing along.
So let me introduce to you
The one and only Billy Shears
And Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band.

Rattle and roll,
I said shake, rattle, and roll
Well you never do nothing
To save your doggone soul
Well get out of that kitchen
And shake those pots and pans
I said get out of that kitchen
And shake those pots and pans
I said to my soul:
You're the devil in the frying pan
Well I said shake, rattle, and roll
I said shake, rattle, and roll

I said shake, rattle, and roll
Well you never do nothing

You think you lost your love,
When I saw her yesterday.
It's you she's thinking of
And she told me what to say.
She says she loves you
And you know that can't be bad.
Yes, she loves you
And you know you should be glad. Ooh!
She said you hurt her so
That she almost lost her mind.
And she said to let you know
You're not the hurting kind.
She says she loves you
And you know that can't be bad.
Yes, she loves you
And you know you should be glad. Ooh!
She loves you, yeah, yeah, yeah
She loves you, yeah, yeah, yeah
And with a love like that
You know you should be glad.
And now it's up to you,
I think it's only fair,
Pride can hurt you too
Apologize to her
Because she loves you
And you know that can't be bad.
Yes, she loves you
And you know you should be glad. Ooh!
She loves you, yeah, yeah, yeah
She loves you, yeah, yeah, yeah
And with a love like that
You know you should be glad.
With a love like that
You know you should be glad.
With a love like that,
You know you sho-o-ould
Be Glad!
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Yeah, yeah, yeah Ye-ah.

My love don't give me presents
I know that she's no peasant
Only ever has to give me
Love forever and forever
My love don't give me presents
Turn me on when I get lonely
People tell me that she's only
Fooling, I know she isn't
She don't give the boys the eye
She hates to see me cry
She is happy just to hear me say
That I will never leave her
She don't give the boys the eye
She will never make me jealous
Gives me all her time as well as
Loving, don't ask me why
She's a woman who understands
She's a woman who loves her man
My love don't give me presents
I know that she's no peasant
Only ever has to give me love
Forever and forever
My love don't give me presents
Turn me on when I get lonely
People tell me that she's only
Fooling, I know she isn't
She's a woman who understands
She's a woman who loves her man
My love don't give me presents
I know that she's no peasant
Only ever has to give me
Love forever and forever
My love don't give me presents
Turn me on when I get lonely
People tell me that she's only
Fooling, I know she isn't
She's a woman, she's a woman
She's a woman, she's a woman

I forgot to remember to forget her
I can't seem to get her off my mind
I thought I'd never miss her
But I've found out somehow
I think about her almost all the time
Well the day she went away
I made myself a promise
That I'd soon forget we'd ever met
But something sure is wrong
Cos I'm so blue and lonely
I forgot to remember to forget
Well the day she went away
I made myself a promise
That I'd soon forget we'd ever met
But something sure is wrong
Cos I'm so blue and lonely
I forgot to remember to forget

Wednesday morning at five o'clock as the day begins
Silently closing her bedroom door
Leaving the note that she hoped would say more
She goes downstairs to the kitchen clutching her hankerchief
Quietly turning the backdoor key
Stepping outside she is free
She (We gave her most of our lives)
Is leaving (Sacraficed most of our lives)
Home (We gave her everything money could buy)
She's leaving home after living alone
For so many years (Bye bye)
Father snores as his wife gets into her dressing gown
Picks up the letter that's lying there
Standing alone at the top of the stairs
She breaks down and cries to her husband "Daddy our baby's gone
Why would she treat us so thoughtlessly?
How could she do this to me?"
She (We never thought of ourselves)
Is leaving (Never a thought for ourselves)
Home (We struggled hard all our lives to get by)
She's leaving home after living alone
For so many years (Bye bye)
Friday morning at nine o'clock she is far away
Waiting to keep the appointment she made
Meeting a man from the motor trade
She (What did we do that was wrong)
Is having (We didn't know it was wrong)
Fun (Fun is the one thing that money can't buy)
Something inside that was always denied
For so many years (Bye bye)
She's leaving home
Bye bye

They say that everyone

So how come no one
wants me.
Then they say that everyone

Something in the way she moves
Attracts me like no other lover
Something in the way she woos me
I don't want to leave her now
You know I believe her now
Somewhere in her smile she knows
That I don't need no other lover
Something in her style that shows me
Don't want to leave her now
You know I believe her now
You're asking me will my love grow
I don't know, I don't know
You stick around now it may show
I don't know, I don't know
Something in the way she knows
And all I have to do is think of her
Something in the things she shows me
Don't want to leave her now
You know I believe her now

Wise: Boys! And what I was thinking was, er ... would you like to do a number with us, you know, we'd like to do a number together
Beatles: Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Wise: You fancy that? Great!
Morecambe: Yeah-eh! It's the Kay sisters, they've come! Great! Fabulous!
Wise: The Kay sisters?! This is...
Morecambe: Look, they've dyed their hair!
Wise: ...this is the Beatles!
Morecambe: Hello, Beatle! Where is he?
Wise: Where is he?
Morecambe: There he is! Hello, Bongo! Hey.
Wise: That's Ringo!
Morecambe: Oh, is he there as well? ... oh dear
Wise : Boys!
Morecambe: By golly!
Wise: As you can gather this is Eric. Say hello to Eric.
Morecambe: Yes.
Paul: Hello, Eric!
Morecambe: Hello, mate!
Paul: I remember you, you're the one with the short fat hairy legs!
Morecambe: No, no, no. It's... no, he's the one with the short fat hairy legs. No, him.
Wise: Yeah.
George: We're the ones with the big fat hairy heads. Get out of that!
[George puts his hand (opened flat, palm down, under Eric M's chin when saying "Get out of that".) That was Eric's trick on Ernie (a running gag). "Get out of that, eh? You can't can you!!". If that's not funny to you, you had to be there!]
Morecambe: Hey! Hey-hey! What's it like being famous?
John: Well, it's not like in your day, you know.
[John, insulting them, by saying they are oldies with this remark! Makes a gesture of "very far away" with his hands]
Morecambe: Ha! That was an insult, that is!
Morecambe: You didn't expect that, did you?
Wise: No!
Morecambe: What do you mean "not like in my day"?
John: Well, me dad used to tell me about you, you know.
[John indicated with his hand how tall he was, when his Dad told him ... just a little kid. Eric misunderstands (deliberately) ...
Paul: ... In the old days.
Morecambe: You've only got a little dad have you?
Morecambe: [mocking] Yer dad used to tell yer, that's a bit strong, innit? Alright, Bonzo!
Wise: That's Ringo!
Morecambe: Yeah, him as well!
Morecambe: Get 'em off, you've done enough.
[Pretending their "time slot" is up, get them off the stage, or done enough damage with their behaviour :) ]
Wise: What do you mean "done enough"?
Morecambe: No, well I'm getting insulted now ...
Wise: No. Look, what I was going to suggest was let's do a number with the boys!
Morecambe: Oh yes! One that the dad will remember. That I used to do, with your dad.
Wise: You go and get changed.
Morecambe: Yes, I will, right.
Wise: What do you think we should do, boys? What about something that's more suitable for Eric's age?
John: "Moonlight Bay".
Wise: "Moonlight Bay".
John: Yeah.
Wise: So ladies and gentlemen, we're gonna make history on television. For the first time we have Morecambe and Wise and the Beatles presenting to you that wonderful old fashioned number "Moonlight Bay". You all remember the number. Okay, fellows, that's great, you look marvellous! You ready?
John/Paul: Aye
Paul: Alright, ready.
Wise: Alright, we'll take it from the top.
Wise: Okay, Kenny, thank you

Steek 'm op, steek 'm in je mond en begin
te roken, smoken en haal 'm in je longen
en als je net bent begonnen
dan voel je dat de stress wel wordt verdrongen.
Door die blunt straight to the point,
een splunt, een stikkie of liever een joint.
Van harddrugs heb ik geen hoge dunk ik rook alleen skunk,
dus noem me geen junk punt
Pak het op, rol het op, steek'm op en rook 'm op
je passed 'm door en tikt erop en opeens dan is ie op.
Hasj & Weed wiede wiede wiet,
je ruikt hem wel je rookt hm niet.
Ben je stoned en word je dronken
je hart gaan bonken, nu ben je stronken.
Je taaie kwaaie moet zich ontlaaien,
dus het wordt weer tijd om een joint te draaien.
Steek 'm op ja!
Steek 'm op ja!
Steek 'm op ja!
Steek 'm op ja!
Steek 'm op ja!
Steek 'm op ja!
Rol 'm op en steek m op en rook 'm op ja!
Waar King woont wordt wied gekloond,
dus nu wordt hij stoned, beloond en bekroond.
Een puur natuur kuur van een uur, van King Arthur is niet zo duur.
Eigen teeltje, want dat scheelt je toch een geeltje
of een meier, we worden higher, het maakt ons blijer,
en als ik ga vrijen dan blijf ik glijen.
King's plantage wordt een ravage,
als we hem oogsten worden we het hoogste.
M'n plantjes worden dope, m'n plantjes worden doper,
je kan wel naar de coffeeshop maar dit is goedkoper.
Deze week is spacecake week, door King gekweekt dus Def bezweek.
Bij elk trekkie denkt ie aan een plekkie voor een stekkie
ik rol hem in een shaggie en dan voel ik me te gekkie!
Steek 'm op ja!
Steek 'm op ja!
Steek 'm op ja!
Steek 'm op ja!
Steek 'm op ja!
Steek 'm op ja!
Rol 'm op en steek m op en rook 'm op ja!
Ben je blowrijp, pak de blowpijp,
en zuig er aan zoals je hoofd-pijpt.
Kom is hier griet, en proef m'n wiet,
jij zuigt me joint en ik zuig je tiet.
Geen slet in m'n bek met een sigaret
want ik rook alleen met vol pret
ik geniet ervan zoveel ik kan,
want bemoeierige bitchen houden we niet van.
Zotte teksten, ik zal er in flexen
om daarna met de posse te relaxen.
Rook je een joint dan voel je je space,
maar met de pijp krijg je echt hoogtevrees.
Kom maar gauw, het huis staat blauw,
genoeg THC voor mij en jou.
Dus wordt het saai, draai dan wat Tai,
en dan worden we zo high als een Vlaamse Papegaai.
Steek 'm op ja!
Steek 'm op ja!
Steek 'm op ja!
Steek 'm op ja!
Steek 'm op ja!
Steek 'm op ja!
Rol 'm op en steek m op en rook 'm op ja!
Steek 'm op ja!
Steek 'm op ja!
Steek 'm op ja!
Steek 'm op ja!
Steek 'm op ja!
Steek 'm op ja!
Rol 'm op en steek m op en rook 'm op ja!
All day all night in da party
everyone smoking sensimilla.

Let me take you down, cos I'm going to Strawberry Fields
Nothing is real and nothing to get hung about
Strawberry Fields forever
Living is easy with eyes closed
Misunderstanding all you see
It's getting hard to be someone but it all works out
It doesn't matter much to me
Let me take you down, cos I'm going to Strawberry Fields
Nothing is real and nothing to get hung about
Strawberry Fields forever
No one I think is in my tree
I mean it must be high or low
That is you can't you know tune in but it's all right
That is I think it's not too bad
Let me take you down, cos I'm going to Strawberry Fields
Nothing is real and nothing to get hung about
Strawberry Fields forever
Always, no sometimes, think it's me
But you know I know when it's a dream
I think I know I mean a "Yes" but it's all wrong

Let me take you down, 'cause I'm going to Strawberry Fields.
Nothing is real and nothing to get hung about.
Strawberry Fields forever.
Living is easy with eyes closed, misunderstanding all you see.
It's getting hard to be someone but it all works out, it doesn't matter much to me.
Let me take you down, 'cause I'm going to Strawberry Fields.
Nothing is real and nothing to get hung about.
Strawberry Fields forever.
No one I think is in my tree, I mean it must be high or low.

Nothing is real and nothing to get hung about.
Strawberry Fields forever.
Always, no sometimes, think it's me, but you know I know when it's a dream.
I think I know I mean a 'Yes' but it's all wrong, that is I think I disagree.
Let me take you down, 'cause I'm going to Strawberry Fields.
Nothing is real and nothing to get hung about.
Strawberry Fields forever.

Well let me tell you well no chick made
could be the same
as Sweet Georgia Brown.
Crazy feet that dance so neat
has sweet Georgia Brown.
Fella's sigh, and even cry
for sweet Georgia Brown.
I tell you just why
you know I don't lie.
It's been said
she knocks them dead
in any old town.
Since she came right
it's a shame
how she brings them down.
In Liverpool she even dare
to critize the Beatles' hair.
With their whole fanclub
standing there
I mean sweet Georgia Brown.
I say this group is absolutely marvellous with the piano, don't you
think so. Not too commercial, boys, not too commercial!
When it comes to music
Sweet Georgia is known to mind,
Don't buy clothes at fashion shows
but she still looks fine
Snap chicks cry,
they want to die
when Georgie does the twist
I never would try
to tell you just why.
Use your imagination
Theres a DJ crazy for her
living in out home town
since she came it's a shame
she turns him down
records that she can get
are records, they ain't sent him yet
Carolina may have Dina,
but that don't have Georgia Brown.
Oh that sweet Georgia,
Yeah yeah yeah I mean Brown, oh oh oh.
Sweet Georgia Brown.

They're really rocking in Boston
Philadelphia, PA
Deep in the heart of Texas

Framed autographs

Philadelphia, PA
Deep in the heart of Texas
On down in Frisco Bay
All over Saint Louis
On down to New Orleans
All the cats want to dance with
Sweet little sixteen

My tears are falling
'cos you've taken her away.
And though it really hurts me so,
there something that I got to say:
Take good care of my baby,
please don't ever make her blue.
Just tell her that you love her
make sure you're thinking of her
in everything you say and do.
Take good care of my baby,
now don't you ever make her cry.
Just let your love surround her,
paint rainbows all around her,
don't let her see the cloudy sky.
Once upon a time
that little girl was mine.
If I had been true
I know she'd never been with you.
So take good care of my baby,
be just as kind as you can be.
And if you should discover
that you don't really love her
just send my baby back home to me.
Take good care of my baby,
be just as kind as you can be.
And if you should discover
that you don't really love her
just send my baby back home to me.
Take good care of my baby,
take good care of my baby,
take good care of my baby.

If you leave me baby,
I don't know what I'll do.
I guess I would die, sweetheart
if I don't get a kiss from you.
Take out some insurance on me baby,
take out some insurance on me baby.
Well if you ever ever say goodbye,
I'm gonna walk right back and die.
Oh if you want me baby,
you got to come to me.
I'm just like a string feeling,
You just can't lose me.
Take out some insurance on me baby,
ooo some insurance on me baby.
Well if you ever ever say goodbye,
I'm gonna walk right over and die.
Well if you want me baby,
mm you got to come to me.
I'm just like a strong feeling,
You just can't lose me.
Take out some insurance on me baby,
mm some insurance on me baby.
Well if you ever ever say goodbye,
I'm gonna walk right over and die.
Well if you leave me baby,
I don't know what I'll do.
I guess I would die, sweetheart,
if I don't get a kiss from you.
Take out some insurance on me baby,
ooo some goddamn insurance on me baby.
If you ever ever say goodbye,
I'm gonna walk right over and die.

Tell me why you cried, and why you lied to me
Tell me why you cried, and why you lied to me

But you left me sitting on my own
Did you have to treat me oh so bad
All I do is hang my head and moan
Tell me why you cried, and why you lied to me

From door to door
The love I crave
I can't find no more
I got to find my baby
I declare there ain't no lie
I ain't had no real good loving
Since that woman said goodbye
You know I hate to see the sun
Sinking to the west
Cos I know my whole life's
Gonna be one solid mess
I got to find my baby
I declare there ain't no lie
I ain't had no real good loving
Since that woman said goodbye
Well ever since the day
That she said we were through
I've been nervous
And shook up too
I got to find my baby
I declare there ain't no lie
I ain't had no real good loving
Since that woman said goodbye
Well I don't care if the last thing
I ever done in my life
Is to find that little woman
Make her my wife
I got to find my baby
I declare there ain't no lie
I ain't had no real good loving
Since that woman said goodbye

Oh, oh, you've been good to me.
You made me glad when I was blue
And eternally,
I'll always be in love with you
And all I wanna do
Is thank you, girl.
Thank you, girl.
I could tell the world
A thing or two about our love.
I know, little girl,
Only a fool would doubt our love
And all I've gotta do
Is thank you, girl.
Thank you, girl.
Thank you, girl, for lovin' me
The way that you do.
Way that you do.
That's the kind of love that seems
To good to be true
And all I've gotta do
Is thank you, girl.
Thank you, girl.
Oh, oh, mmm, you've been good to me.
You made me glad when I was blue
And eternally,
I'll always be in love with you
And all I wanna do
Is thank you, girl.
Thank you, girl.
Oh, oh, mmm.
Oh, oh, mmm.

A friend says that your love
Won't mean a lot
And you know that your love
Is all you've got
At times things are so fine
And at times they're not
But when she says she loves you
That means a lot
A friend says that a love
Is never true
And you know that this
Don't apply on you
A touch can mean so much
When it's all you've got
When she says she loves you
That means a lot
Love can be deep inside
Love can be suicide
Can't you see you can't hide
What you feel when it's real
A friend says that your love
Won't mean a lot
And you know that your love
Is all you've got
A touch can mean so much
When it's all you've got
But when she says she loves you
That means a lot
Can't you see, yeah
Can't you see, yeah
Can't you see, yeah
Can't you see, yeah
Can't you see, yeah
Can't you see, yeah
Can't you see, yeah

Without going out of my door
I can know all things on Earth
Without looking out of my window
I could know the ways of Heaven
The farther one travels
The less one knows
The less one really knows
Without going out of your door
You can know all things on Earth
Without looking out of your window
You could know the ways of Heaven
The farther one travels
The less one knows
The less one really knows
Arrive without travelling
See all without looking
Do all without doing

The long and winding road that leads to your door
Will never disappear
I've seen that road before it always leads me here
Leads me to your door
The wild and windy night that the rain washed away
Has left a pool of tears crying for the day
Why leave me standing here, let me know the way
Many times I've been alone and many times I've cried
Anyway you'll never know the many ways I've tried
And still they lead me back to the long and winding road
You left me standing here a long, long time ago
Don't leave me waiting here, lead me to you door
But still they lead me back to the long and winding road
You left me standing here a long, long time ago
Don't keep me waiting here (Don't keep me wait), lead me to you door
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

Well you call me your baby
When you hold in my hand
But the way that you hurt me
I just don't understand
Well you say that you need me
Like an ocean needs sand
But the way you deceive me
I just don't understand
Well you know that I love you
More than anyone can
But a one-sided love
I just don't understand
Well you know that I love you
More than anyone can
But a one-sided love
I just don't understand
Well you call me your baby
When you hold in my hand
Oh how you can hurt me
I just don't understand

We said our goodbyes, ah, the night before
Love was in your eyes, ah, the night before
Now today I find you have changed your mind
Treat me like you did the night before
Were you telling lies, ah, the night before?
Was I so unwise, ah, the night before?
When I held you near you were so sincere
Treat me like you did the night before
Last night is a night I will remember you by
When I think of things we did it makes me wanna cry
We said our goodbye, ah, the night before
Love was in your eyes, ah, the night before
Now today I find you have changed your mind
Treat me like you did the night before
Yes
When I held you near you were so sincere
Treat me like you did the night before
Last night is a night I will remember you by
When I think of things we did it makes me wanna cry
Were you telling lies, ah, the night before?
Was I so unwise, ah, the night before?
When I held you near you were so sincere
Treat me like you did the night before
Like the night before

Day after day alone on a hill
the man with the foolish grin is keeping perfectly still
But nobody wants to know him,
they can see that he`s just a fool
and he never gives an answer
but the fool on the hill sees the sun going downand the eyes in his head see the world spinning `round.
Well on the way, head in a cloud
the man of the thousand voices talking perfectly loud,
but nobody ever hears him, or the sound he appears to make
and he never seems to notice.
But the fool on the hill sees the sun going downand the eyes in his head see the world spinning `round.
And nobody seems to like him,
they can tell what he wants to do
and he never shows his feelings
But the fool on the hill sees the sun going downand the eyes in his head see the world spinning `round.
He never listens to them
he knows that they`re the fool
they don`t like him.
The fool on the hill sees the sun going downand the eyes in his head see the world spinning `round.
(Original track released 1967)

There are places I remember
All my life though some have changed
Some forever, not for better
Some have gone and some remain
All these places have their moments
With lovers and friends I still can recall
Some are dead and some are living
In my life I've loved them all
But of all these friends and lovers
There is no one compares with you
And these memories lose their meaning
When I think of love as something new
Though I know I'll never lose affection
For people and things that went before
I know I'll often stop and think about them
In my life I love you more
Though I remember I'll never lose affection
For people and things that went before
I know I'll often stop and think about them
In my life I'll love you more
In my life I'll love you more

There is a place
Where I can go
When I feel low
When I feel blue
And it's my mind
And there's no time when I'm alone
I think of you
And things you do
Go 'round my head
The things you said
Like "I love only you"
In my mind there's no sorrow
Don't you know that it's so
There'll be no sad tomorrow
Don't you know that it's so
There is a place
Where I can go
When I feel low
When I feel blue
And it's my mind
And there's no time when I'm alone
There's a place...

I've got a word or two
To say about the things that you do
You're telling all those lies
About the good things that we can have
If we close our eyes
Do what you want to do
And go where you're going to
Think for yourself
Cos I won't be there with you
I left you far behind
The ruins of the life that you have in mind
And though you still can't see
I know your mind's made up
You're gonna cause more misery
Do what you want to do
And go where you're going to
Think for yourself
Cos I won't be there with you
Although your mind's opaque
Try thinking more if just for your own sake
The future still looks good
And you've got time to rectify
All the things that you should
Do what you want to do
And go where you're going to
Think for yourself
Cos I won't be there with you
Do what you want to do
And go where you're going to
Think for yourself
Cos I won't be there with you
Think for yourself
Cos I won't be there with you

All through the day, I me mine
I me mine, I me mine
All through the night, I me mine

No-one's frightened of playing it
Everyone's saying it
Flowing more freely than wine
All through the day I me mine
I-I-me-me mine, I-I-me-me mine
I-I-me-me mine, I-I-me-me mine
All I can hear, I me mine
I me mine, I me mine
Even those tears, I me mine
I me mine, I me mine
No-one's frightened of playing it
Everyone's saying it
Flowing more freely than wine
All through your life I me mine

There were bells on a hill
But I never heard them ringing
No, I never heard them at all
Till there was you
There were birds in the sky
But I never saw them winging
No, I never saw them at all
Till there was you
Then there was music and wonderful roses
They tell me in sweet fragrant meadows
Of dawn and dew
There was love all around
But I never heard it singing
No, I never heard it at all
Till there was you
Then there was music and wonderful roses
They tell me in sweet fragrant meadows
Of dawn and dew
There was love all around
But I never heard it singing
No, I never heard it at all
Till there was you
Till there was you

Try to see it my way,
Do I have to keep on talking till I can't go on
While you see it your way,
Run the risk of knowing that our love may soon be gone.
We can work it out,
We can work it out.
Think of what you're saying.
You can get it wrong and still you think that it's alright.
Think of what I'm saying,
We can work it out and get it straight, or say good night.
We can work it out,
We can work it out.
Life is very short, and there's no time
For fussing and fighting, my friend.
I have always thought that it's a crime,
So I will ask you once again.
Try to see it my way,
Only time will tell if I am right or I am wrong.
While you see it your way
There's a chance that we may fall apart before too long.
We can work it out,
We can work it out.

We can work it out.

Look what you're doing, I'm feeling blue and lonely
Would it be too much to ask you
What you're doing to me?
You got me running and there's no fun in it
Why should it be so much to ask of you
What you're doing to me?
I've been waiting here for you
Wond'ring what you're gonna do
Should you need a love that's true
It's me
Please stop your lying, you've got me crying, girl
Why should it be so much to ask of you
What you're doing to me?
I've been waiting here for you
Wond'ring what you're gonna do
Should you need a love that's true
It's me
Please stop your lying, you've got me crying, girl
Why should it be so much to ask of you
What you're doing to me?
What you're doing to me?
What you're doing to me?

You don't realize how much I need you
Love you all the time and never leave you
Please come on back to me
I'm lonely as can be
I need you
Said you had a thing or two to tell me
How was I to know you would upset me?
I didn't realize as I looked in your eyes
You told me, oh yes, you told me, you don't want my lovin' anymore
That's when it hurt me and feeling like this I just can't go on anymore
Please remember how I feel about you
I could never really live without you
So, come on back and see just what you mean to me. I need you
But when you told me, you don't want my lovin' anymore
That's when it hurt me and feeling like this I just can't go on anymore
Please remember how I feel about you
I could never really live without you
So, come on back and see just what you mean to me
I need you
I need you
I need you

When I get older, losing my hair, many years from now,
Will you still be sending me a Valentine,birthday greetings, bottle of wine?
If I'd been out 'till quarter to three,would you lock the door?
Will you still need me, will you still feed me,
When I'm sixty-four?
Hmm------mmm---mmmh.
You'll be older, too.Aaah, and if you say the word, I could stay with you.
I could be handy, mending a fuse, when your lights have gone.
You can knit a sweater by the fireside, sunday mornings, go for a ride.
Doing the garden, digging the weeds, who could ask for more?
Will you still need me, will you still feed me, when I'm sixty four?
Every summer we can rent a cottage in the Isle of Wightif it's not to dear. We shall scrimp and save.
Ah, grandchildren on your knee, Vera, Chuck, and Dave.
Send me a postcard, drop me a line stating point of view.
Indicate precisely what you mean to say, yours sincerely wasting away.
Give me your answer, fill in a form, mine forever more.
Will you still need me, will you still feed me, when I'm sixty four?

I look at you all see the love there that's sleeping
While my guitar gently weeps
I look at the floor and I see it needs sweeping
Still my guitar gently weeps
I don't know why nobody told you
How to unfold your love
I don't know how someone controlled you
They bought and sold you
I look at the world and I notice it's turning
While my guitar gently weeps
With every mistake we must surely be learning
Still my guitar gently weeps
Well?
I don't know how you were diverted
You were perverted too
I don't know how you were inverted
No one alerted you
I look at you all see the love there that's sleeping
While my guitar gently weeps
Look at you all
Still my guitar gently weeps
Oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, oh, ooh

Why why can't we love again?
Why why are you shy on love?
If you only knew how much I love you,
why can't you love me again?
Why why don't you open your heart?
Why why are we so far apart?
If you only knew how much I love you,
why can't you love me again?
I just want your loving arms around me, yeah,
I got to find a way to make you take me back.
Baby won't you tell me
why why why why are we so far apart?
Why why don't you open your heart?
If you only knew how much I love you,

A little help from my friends
What would you think if I sang out of tune,
Would you stand up and walk out on me
Lend me your ears and I'll sing you a song,
And I'll try not to sing out of key.
I get by with a little help from my friends,
I get high with a little help from my friends,
Going to try with a little help from my friends.
What do I do when my love is away.
(Does it worry you to be alone)
How do I feel by the end of the day
(Are you sad because you're on your own)
No I get by with a little help from my friends,
Do you need anybody,
I need somebody to love.
Could it be anybody
I want somebody to love.
Would you believe in a love at first sight,
Yes I'm certain that it happens all the time.
What do you see when you turn out the light,
I can't tell you, but I know it's mine.
Oh I get by with a little help from my friends,
Do you need anybody,
I just need somebody to love,
Could it be anybody,

We were talking about the space between us all
And the people who hide themselves behind a wall of illusion
Never glimpse the truth, then it's far too late, when they pass away
We were talking about the love we all could share
When we find it, to try our best to hold it there with our love
With our love, we could save the world, if they only knew
Try to realise it's all within yourself
No one else can make you change
And to see you're really only very small
And life flows on within you and without you
We were talking about the love that's gone so cold
And the people who gain the world and lose their soul
They don't know, they can't see, are you one of them?
When you've seen beyond yourself then you may find
Peace of mind is waiting there
And the time will come when you see we're all one
And life flows on within you and without you

Hold me close and tell me how you feel
Tell me love is real
Words of love you whisper soft and true
Darling I love you
Let me hear you say the words I long to hear
Darling when you're near
Words of love you whisper soft and true
Darling I love you

Yesterday, all my troubles seemed so far away
Now it looks as though they're here to stay
Oh, I believe in yesterday
Suddenly, I'm not half the man I used to be
There's a shadow hanging over me.
Oh, I yesterday came suddenly
Why she had to go I don't know she wouldn't say
I said something wrong, now I long for yesterday
Yesterday, love was such an easy game to play
Now I need a place to hide away
Oh, I believe in yesterday
Why she had to go I don't know she wouldn't say
I said something wrong, now I long for yesterday
Yesterday, love was such an easy game to play
Now I need a place to hide away
Oh, I believe in yesterday
Mm mm mm mm mm mm mm

I got something to say that might cause you pain
If I catch you talking to that boy again
I'm gonna let you down
And leave you flat
Because I told you before, oh
You can't do that
Well, it's the second time I've caught you talking to him
Do I have to tell you one more time, I think it's a sin
I think I'll let you down (Let you down)
Leave you flat (Gonna let you down and leave you flat)
Because I've told you before, oh
You can't do that
Everybody's green
Cos I'm the one who won your love
But if they'd seen
You're talking that way they'd laugh in my face
So please listen to me, if you wanna stay mine
I can't help my feelings, I'll go out of my mind
I'm gonna let you down (Let you down)
And leave you flat (Gonna let you down and leave you flat)
Because I've told you before, oh
You can't do that, oh
(You can't do that
You can't do that
You can't do that
You can't do that
You can't do that)
Everybody's green
Cos I'm the one who won your love
But if they'd seen

Though you've gone away this morning
You'll be back again tonight
Telling me there'll be no next time
If I don't just don't treat you right
You'll never leave me and you know it's true
Cos you like me too much and I like you
You've tried before to leave me
But you haven't got the nerve
To walk out and make me lonely
Which is all that I deserve
You'll never leave me and you know it's true
Cos you like me too much and I like you
I really do, and it's nice when you believe me
If you leave me
I will follow you and bring you back where you belong
Cos I could't really stand it
I admit that I was wrong
I wouldn't let you leave me cos it's true
Cos you like me too much and I like you
Cos you like me too much and I like you
I really do, and it's nice when you believe me

I don't like you but I love you
Seems that I'm always thinking of you
Oh oh oh you treat me badly, I love you madly
You've really got a hold on me
Baby I don't want you but I need you
Don't want to kiss you but I need to
Oh oh oh you do me wrong now, my love is strong now
You've really got a hold on me
Baby I love you and all I want you to do is just
Hold me, hold me, hold me, hold me
Tired of, tired of...
I want to leave you, don't want to stay here
Don't want to spend another day here
Oh oh oh I want to split now, I just can't quit now
You've really got a hold on me
Baby I love you and all I want you to do is just
Hold me please, hold me squeeze, hold me, hold me
You've really got a hold on me
You've really got a hold on me

When I call you up
Your line's engaged
I have had enough
So act your age
We have lost the time
That was so hard to find
And I will lose my mind
If you won't see me (You won't see me)
You won't see me (You won't see me)
I don't know why you
Should want to hide
But I can't get through
My hands are tied
I won't want to stay
I don't have much to say
But I can't turn away
And you won't see me (You won't see me)
You won't see me (You won't see me)
Time after time
You refuse to even listen
I wouldn't mind
If I knew what I was missing
Though the days are few
They're filled with tears
And since I lost you
It feels like years
Yes, it seems so long
Girl, since you've been gone
And I just can't go on
If you won't see me (You won't see me)
You won't see me (You won't see me)
Time after time
You refuse to even listen

Yes, it seems so long
Girl, since you've been gone

You're going to lose that girl
You're going to lose that girl
If you don't take her out tonight
She's going to change her mind
And I will take her out tonight
And I will treat her kind
You're going to lose that girl
You're going to lose that girl
If you don't treat her right, my friend
You're going to find her gone
Cos I will treat her right, and then
You'll be the lonely one
You're going to lose that girl
You're going to lose that girl
I'll make a point
Of taking her away from you, yeah
The way you treat her what else can I do?
You're going to lose that girl

You're going to lose that girl
You're going to lose that girl
You're going to lose that girl

I should have known better with a girl like you
That I would love everything that you do
And I do, hey, hey, hey, and I do
Whoa, oh, I never realized what a kiss could be
This could only happen to me
Can't you see, can't you see
That when I tell you that I love you, oh
You're gonna say you love me too, oh
And when I ask you to be mine
You're gonna say you love me too
So I should have realized a lot of things before
If this is love you've got to give me more
Give me more, hey hey hey, give me more
Whoa, oh, I never realized what a kiss could be
This could only happen to me
Can't you see, can't you see
That when I tell you that I love you, oh
You're gonna say you love me too, oh
And when I ask you to be mine
You're gonna say you love me too
You love me too, you love me too
You love me too

Here I stand head in hand
Turn my face to the wall
If she's gone I can't go on
Feeling two-foot small
Everywhere people stare
Each and every day
I can see them laugh at me
And I hear them say
Hey you've got to hide your love away
Hey you've got to hide your love away
How can I even try
I can never win
Hearing them, seeing them
In the state I'm in
How could she say to me
Love will find a way
Gather round all you clowns
Let me hear you say
Hey you've got to hide your love away
Hey you've got to hide your love away

I want to tell you
My head is filled with things to say
When you're here
All those words, they seem to slip away
When I get near you
The games begin to drag me down
It's alright
I'll make you maybe next time around
But if I seem to act unkind
It's only me, it's not my mind
That is confusing things
I want to tell you
I feel hung up but I don't know why
I don't mind
I could wait forever, I've got time
Sometimes I wish I knew you well,
Then I could speak my mind and tell you
Maybe you'd understand
I want to tell you
I feel hung up but I don't know why
I don't mind
I could wait forever, I've got time, I've got time, I've got time

But I came back again
I love you so
I'm the one who wants you
Yes, I'm the one
Who wants you, oh ho, oh ho, oh
You could find better things to do
Than to break my heart again
This time I will try to show that I'm
Not trying to pretend
I thought that you would realize
That if I ran away from you
That you would want me too
But I got a big surprise
Oh ho, oh ho, oh
You could find better things to do
Than to break my heart again
This time I will try to show that I'm
Not trying to pretend
I wanna go but I hate to leave you,
You know I hate to leave you , oh ho, oh ho, oh
You, if you break my heart I'll go
But I'll be back again

I've got every reason on earth to be mad
Cos I've just lost the only girl I had
And if I could get my way
I'd get myself locked up today
But I can't so I cry instead
I've got a chip on my shoulder that's bigger than my feet
I can't talk to people that I meet
And if I could see you now
I'd try to make you sad somehow
But I can't so I cry instead
Don't want to cry when there's people there
I get shy when they start to stare
I'm gonna hide myself away, ay hay
But I'll come back again someday
And when I do you'd better hide all the girls
I'm gonna break their hearts all 'round the world
Yes, I'm gonna break them in two
And show you what your loving man can do
Until then I'll cry instead
Don't want to cry when there's people there
I get shy when they start to stare
I'm gonna hide myself away, ay hay
But I'll come back again someday
And when I do you'd better hide all the girls
Cos I'm gonna break their hearts all 'round the world
Yes, I'm gonna break them in two
And show you what your loving man can do
Until then I'll cry instead

One day you'll look to see I've gone
For tomorrow may rain, so I'll follow the sun
Some day you'll know I was the one
But tomorrow may rain, so I'll follow the sun
And now the time has come
And so my love I must go
And though I lose a friend
In the end you will know, oooh
One day you'll find that I have gone
But tomorrow may rain, so I'll follow the sun
Yea, tomorrow may rain, so I'll follow the sun

Before this dance is through
I think I'll love you too
I'm so happy when you dance with me
I don't want to kiss or hold your hand
If it's funny try and understand
There is really nothing else I'd rather do
Cos I'm happy just to dance with you
I don't need to hug or hold you tight
I just want to dance with you all night
In this world there's nothing I would rather do
Cos I'm happy just to dance with you
Just to dance with you
It's everything I need
Before this dance is through
I think I'll love you too
I'm so happy when you dance with me
If somebody tries to take my place
Let's pretend we just can't see his face
In this world there's nothing I would rather do
Cos I'm happy just to dance with you
Just to dance with you
It's everything I need
Before this dance is through
I think I'll love you too
I'm so happy when you dance with me
If somebody tries to take my place
Let's pretend we just can't see his face
In this world there's nothing I would rather do
I've discovered I'm in love with you
Cos I'm happy just to dance with you

I'm looking through you, where did you go?
I thought I knew you, what did I know?
You don't look different, but you have changed
I'm looking through you, you're not the same
Your lips are moving, I cannot hear
Your voice is soothing, but the words aren't clear
You don't sound different, I've learned the game
I'm looking through you, you're not the same
Why, tell me why, did you not treat me right?
Love has a nasty habit of disappearing overnight
You're thinking of me, the same old way
You were above me, but not today
The only difference is you're down there
I'm looking through you, and you're nowhere
Why, tell me why, did you not treat me right?
Love has a nasty habit of disappearing overnight
I'm looking through you, where did you go
I thought I knew you, what did I know
You don't look different, but you have changed
I'm looking through you, you're not the same
Yeah
Oh baby I'm changed
Ah I'm looking through you
Yeah I'm looking through you

I'm a loser
I'm a loser
And I'm not what I appear to be
Of all the love I have won or have lost
There is one love I should never have crossed
She was a girl in a million, my friend
I should have known she would win in the end
I'm a loser
And I lost someone who's near to me
I'm a loser
And I'm not what I appear to be
Although I laugh and I act like a clown
Beneath this mask I am wearing a frown
My tears are falling like rain from the sky
Is it for her or myself that I cry
I'm a loser
And I lost someone who's near to me
I'm a loser
And I'm not what I appear to be
What have I done to deserve such a fate
I realize I have left it too late
And so it's true, pride comes before a fall
I'm telling you so that you won't lose all
I'm a loser
And I lost someone who's near to me
I'm a loser
And I'm not what I appear to be

When I wake up early in the morning
Lift my head, I'm still yawning
When I'm in the middle of a dream
Stay in bed, float up stream (Float up stream)
Please, don't wake me, no, don't shake me
Leave me where I am, I'm only sleeping
Everybody seems to think I'm lazy
I don't mind, I think they're crazzy
Running everywhere at such a speed
Till they find there's no need (There's no need)
Please, don't spoil my day, I'm miles away
And after all I'm only sleeping
Keeping an eye on the world going by my window
Taking my time
Lying there and staring at the ceiling
Waiting for a sleepy feeling...
Please, don't spoil my day, I'm miles away
And after all I'm only sleeping
Ooh yeah
Keeping an eye on the world going by my window
Taking my time
When I wake up early in the morning
Lift my head, I'm still yawning
When I'm in the middle of a dream
Stay in bed, float up stream (Float up stream)
Please, don't wake me, no, don't shake me
Leave me where I am, I'm only sleeping

I'm so tired, I haven't slept a wink
I'm so tired, my mind is on the blink
I wonder should I get up and fix myself a drink
No, no, no
I'm so tired I don't know what to do
I'm so tired my mind is set on you
I wonder should I call you but I know what you'd do
You'd say I'm putting you on
But it's no joke, it's doing me harm
You know I can't sleep, I can't stop my brain
You know it's three weeks, I'm going insane
You know I'd give you everything I've got
For a little peace of mind
I'm so tired, I'm feeling so upset
Although I'm so tired I'll have another cigarette
And curse Sir Walter Raleigh
He was such a stupid get
You'd say I'm putting you on
But it's no joke, it's doing me harm
You know I can't sleep, I can't stop my brain
You know it's three weeks, I'm going insane
You know I'd give you everything I've got
For a little peace of mind
I'd give you everything I've got
For a little peace of mind
I'd give you everything I've got
For a little peace of mind

All these years I've been wandering around
Wondering how come nobody told me
All that I was looking for was somebody
Who looked like you

Oh yeah, oh yeah
I've got a feeling, I think that everybody knows
Oh yeah, oh yeah, oh yeah

I can't forget the time or place
Where we just meet
She's just the girl for me
And want all the world to see
We've met, mmm-mmm-mmm-m'mmm-mmm
Had it been another day
I might have looked the other way
And I'd have never been aware
But as it is I'll dream of her
Tonight, di-di-di-di'n'di
Falling, yes I am falling
And she keeps calling
Me back again
I have never known
The like of this, I've been alone
And I have missed things
And kept out of sight
But other girls were never quite
Like this, da-da-n'da-da'n'da
Falling, yes I am falling

Me back again

[All too much!]
It's all too much
It's all too much
When I look into your eyes, your love is there for me
And the more I go inside, the more there is to see
It's all too much for me to take
The love that's shining all around you
Everywhere, it's what you make
For us to take, it's all too much
Floating down the stream of time from life to life with me
Makes no difference where you are or where you'd like to be
It's all too much for me to take
The love that's shining all around here
All the world is birthday cake
So take a piece but not too much
Sail me on a silver sun, where I know that I'm free
Show me that I'm everywhere, and get me home for tea
It's all to much for me to see
The love that's shining all around here
The more I learn, the less I know
But what I do is all too much
It's all too much for me to take
The love that's shining all around you
Everywhere, it's what you make
For us to take, it's all too much
It's too much
Ah, it's too much
With your long blond hair and your eyes of blue
With your long blond hair and your eyes of blue
You're too much, ah

IT'S FOR YOU
WRITERS JOHN LENNON, PAUL McCARTNEY
I'd say some day
I'm bound to give my hert away
When I do
It's for you
It's for you
It's for you
You love true love
Seems to be all I'm thinking of
But it's true
It's for you
They said that love was a lie
Told me that I should never try
To find somebody who'd be kind
Kind to only me
So I just tell them they're right
Who wants a fight
Tell them I quite agree
Nobody'd love me
Then I look at you
And it's for you
It's for you
It's for you
Love comes love shows
I give my heart and no one knows
That I do
It's for you
It's for you

I get high when I see you go by
My oh my
When you sigh, my, my inside just flies
Butterflies
Why am I so shy when I'm beside you?
It's only love and that is all
Why should I feel the way I do?
It's only love, and that is all
But it's so hard loving you
Is it right that you and I should fight
Every night?
Just the sight of you makes nighttime bright
Very bright
Haven't I the right to make it up girl?
It's only love and that is all
Why should I feel the way I do?
It's only love, and that is all
But it's so hard loving you
Yes it's so hard loving you, loving you

There's nothing you can do that can't be done
Nothing you can sing that can't be sung
Nothing you can say, but you can learn how to play the game
It's easy!
Nothing you can make that can't be made
No one you can save that can't be saved
Nothing you can do, but you can learn how to be you in time
It'easy!
Nothing you can know that isn't known
Nothing you can see that isn't shown
Nowhere you can be that isn't where you were meant to be
It'easy!
All you need is Love
Love is all you need.

Hey Jude, don't make it bad.
Take a sad song and make it better.
Remember to let her into your heart,
Then you can start to make it better.
Hey Jude, don't be afraid.
You were made to go out and get her.
The minute you let her under your skin,
Then you begin to make it better.
And anytime you feel the pain, hey Jude, refrain,
Don't carry the world upon your shoulders.
For well you know that it's a fool who plays it cool
By making his world a little colder.
Hey Jude, don't let me down.
You have found her, now go and get her.
Remember to let her into your heart,
Then you can start to make it better.
So let it out and let it in, hey Jude, begin,
You're waiting for someone to perform with.
And don't you know that it's just you, hey Jude, you'll do,
The movement you need is on your shoulder.
Hey Jude, don't make it bad.
Take a sad song and make it better.
Remember to let her under your skin,
Then you'll begin to make it
Better better better better better better, oh.
Naaa na na nananana, nanananaaa  hey Jude...  (repeat X number of times)

When I find myself in times of trouble
Mother Mary comes to me
Speaking words of wisdom, let it be
And in my hour of darknes
She is standing right in front of me
Speaking words of wisdom, let it be
LET IT BE, LET IT BE, LET IT BE, LET IT BE
WHISPER WORDS OF WISDOM, LET IT BE
And when the broken hearted peaple
living in the world agree
there will be an answer, let it be
for though they maybe parted
there is still a chance that they will see
there will be an answer, let it be
LET IT BE, LET IT BE...............
THERE WILL BE AN ANSWER, LET IT BE
And when the night is cloudy
there is still a light that shines on me
shine until tommorow, let it be
I wake up to the sound of music
Mother Mary comes to me
Speaking words of wisdom, let it be
Refrain

If she's gone I can't go on, feeling two foot small
Everywhere people stare each and every way
I can see them laugh at me and I hear them say ay ay
Hey you got to hide your love away
Hey you got to hide your love away
How can I even try, I can never win
Hearing them seeing them in the state I'm in
How could she say to me love will find away
Gather round all you clown, let me hear you say ay ay
Hey you got to hide your love away
Hey you got to hide your love away

Each time I look into your eyes
I see that there a heaven lies
and as I look
I see the love of the loved.
Someday they'll see that from the start
my place has been deep in your heart.
And in your heart
I see the love of the loved.
Though I said it all before
I will say it more and more,
now that I'm really sure
you love me.
And I know that from today
I'll see it in the way
that you look at me
and say ah you love me.
So let it rain, I'll never care?
Deep in your heart, I'd still be there.
And when I'm there
I see the love of the loved.

I took my troubles down to Madame Rue.
You know that gypsy with the gold capped tooth
She's got a pad down on 34th and Vine,
Selling little bottles of Love Potion #9.
I told her that I was a flop with chicks.
I've been disgraced since 1956.
She looked at my palm and she made a magic sign.
She said what you need is Love Potion #9.
She bent down and turned around and gave me a wink.
She said I'm gonna make it up right here in the sink.
It smelled like turpentine, and looked like Indian ink.
I held my nose, I closed my eyes, I took a drink!
I didn't know if it was day or night.
I started kissing everything in sight.
But when I kissed a cop down on 34th and Vine.
He broke my little bottle of Love Potion #9.
(instrumental)

Lee Peters: But now, John has his work cut out on the next one, as he takes his guitar on and off his neck and pulls the harmonica in and out of his face.
John: Harp. It's a harp.
Lee: What? Harp?
John: The harp. 'Cause I'm playing the harp on this one.
Lee: Playing the harp?
John: Harmonica I play on "Love Me Do," harp, on this one, little goes in the orang.
Lee: But it goes in and out? Do you wanna do this announcement? Well, go on, you go ahead, no, it's all right. Tell them. Tell them about the next song.
John: Oh, er, we'd like to carry on with Chuck Berry's "I Gotta Find My Baby." Don't know where she's been, pardon, hello? Love these goon shows.

Picture yourself in a boat on a river,
With tangerine trees and marmalade skies
Somebody calls you, you answer quite slowly,
A girl with kaleidoscope eyes.
Cellophane flowers of yellow and green,
Towering over your head.
Look for the girl with the sun in her eyes,
And she's gone.
Lucy in the sky with diamonds.
Follow her down to a bridge by a fountain
Where rocking horse people eat marshmellow pies,
Everyone smiles as you drift past the flowers,
That grow so incredibly high.
Newpaper taxis appear on the shore,
Waiting to take you away.
Climb in the back with your head in the clouds,
And you're gone.
Lucy in the sky with diamonds,
Picture yourself on a train in a station,
With plasticine porters with looking glass ties,
Suddenly someone is there at the turnstyle,
The girl with the kaleidoscope eyes.

Oh dirty Maggie Mai they have taken her away
And she never walk down Lime Street anymore
Oh the judge he guilty found her
Of robbing home a pounder
That dirty no good robbin' Maggie Mae
Just a part of Liverpool
She earned a term with two
Two pounds ten a week, that was my pay...

Si no te conociera, si no estuviera aquí
No habría encontrado la alegría de vivir
Enciendes melodías que brotan en tu voz
Que calman y apaciguan mi lucha interior
Y aunque somos diferentes, nos une una obsesión
Cantar es nuestra vida y mi música es tu voz
Cuenta con mi vida que hoy la doy por ti
Mi pasión quiero compartir
A tu lado me siento seguro
A tu lado no dudo
A tu lado yo puedo volar
A tu lado brilla mi estrella
A tu lado mi sueño se hará por fin realidad
A tu lado...
Estamos hoy unidos
Cantando esta canción
Mañana separados
Pero unido está el corazón

Doesn't have a point of view
knows not where he's going to
Isn't he a bit like you and me?
Nowhere man please listen
You don't know what you're missing
Nowhere man, The world is at your command
Ah, la, la, la, la
He's a real nowhere man
Sitting in his nowhere land
Making all his nowhere plans for nobody
Making all his nowhere plans for nobody
Making all his nowhere plans for nobody

Born a poor young country boy, Mother Nature's son
All day long I'm sitting singing songs for everyone
Sit beside a mountain stream, see her waters rise
Listen to the pretty sound of music as she flies
Doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo
Doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo
Doo doo doo
Find me in my field of grass, Mother Nature's son
Swaying daises sing a lazy song beneath the sun
Doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo
Doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo
Doo doo doo doo doo doo
Yeah yeah yeah
Mm mm mm mm mm mm mm
Mm mm mm, ooh ooh ooh
Mm mm mm mm mm mm mm
Mm mm mm mm, wah wah wah
Wah, Mother Nature's son

Now it's time to say good night
Good night, sleep tight
Now the sun turns out his light
Good night, sleep tight
Dream sweet dreams for me (Dream sweet)
Dream sweet dreams for you
Close your eyes and I'll close mine
Good night, sleep tight
Now the moon begins to shine
Good night, sleep tight
Dream sweet dreams for me (Dream sweet)
Dream sweet dreams for you
Mmmmmm
Mmmmmm
Mmmmmmmmmm
Close your eyes and I'll close mine
Good night, sleep tight
Now the sun turns out his light
Good night, sleep tight
Dream sweet dreams for me (Dream sweet)
Dream sweet dreams for you
Good night, good night, everybody
Everybody everywhere
Good night

This happened once before
When I came to your door
No reply
They said it wasn't you
But I saw you peep through your window
I saw the lie, I saw the lie
I know that you saw me
As I looked up to your face
I tried to telephone
They said you were not home
That's a lie
Cos I know where you've been
I saw you walk in your door
I nearly died, I nearly died
Cos you walked hand in hand
With another man in my place
If I were you'd realise that I
Love you more than any other guy
And I'll forgive the lies that I
Heard before when you gave me no reply
I've tried to telephone
They said you were not home
That's a lie
Cos I know where you've been
I saw you walk in your door
I nearly died, I nearly died
Cos you walked hand in hand
With another man in my place
No reply, no reply
